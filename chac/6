I’ve sent over the files, but I didn’t get time to relook at them or work on some loopholes. Let me know if anything needs urgent attention.

I’ll be OOO this week as I’m traveling, but I’ll have access and can respond to messages and attend calls post 9 PM IST. I’m also working on some personal research topics, so I’ll be online during that time.

Feel free to reach out if needed, or we can regroup to share tasks on the chunking strategy and discuss parts of the paper. Let me know what works for you.
