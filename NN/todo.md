* **Weight Initialization**: Use smart weight initialization techniques like **He initialization** or **Xavier initialization** to set the starting weights in a way that helps maintain the variance of activations and gradients across layers.
* **Gradient Clipping**: This is a direct solution for exploding gradients. It involves setting a threshold to cap the maximum size of the gradients during backpropagation, preventing them from getting too large.
* **Batch Normalization**: This technique normalizes the output of a layer before it's passed to the next layer. By stabilizing the input distribution of each layer, it helps prevent both vanishing and exploding gradients.
* **Skip Connections**: Architectures like Residual Networks (ResNets) use "skip connections" to allow the gradient to bypass layers. This creates a direct path for the gradient to flow backward, helping to solve the vanishing gradient problem in very deep networks.

# üìò Remaining Important Concepts in ANNs

---

## 1. **Weight Initialization**

* Poor initialization can cause:

  * **Vanishing gradients** (too small ‚Üí slow learning)
  * **Exploding gradients** (too large ‚Üí unstable learning)
* Common methods:

  * **Xavier/Glorot initialization** (for sigmoid/tanh)
  * **He initialization** (for ReLU/Leaky ReLU)
* Intuition: keeps the variance of activations roughly constant across layers.

---

## 2. **Regularization Techniques**

* Prevent overfitting, especially in large networks:

  * **L1/L2 weight regularization** ‚Üí penalize large weights
  * **Dropout** ‚Üí randomly deactivate neurons during training
  * **Early stopping** ‚Üí stop when validation loss stops improving

---

## 3. **Optimization Algorithms**

* Vanilla gradient descent isn‚Äôt always sufficient:

  * **Momentum** ‚Üí remembers past gradients for smoother convergence
  * **AdaGrad / RMSProp / Adam** ‚Üí adaptive learning rates per parameter
* Choice of optimizer affects speed and stability of learning.

---

## 4. **Batching**

* Full-batch vs mini-batch vs stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
* Mini-batch is most common; balances **gradient stability** and **training speed**

---

## 5. **Overfitting vs Underfitting**

* Overfitting: low training loss, high validation loss ‚Üí model memorized data
* Underfitting: high loss on both training and validation ‚Üí model too simple
* Controlled via regularization, network size, and training duration

---

## 6. **Network Architecture Choices**

* **Number of hidden layers** ‚Üí depth
* **Number of neurons per layer** ‚Üí width
* **Activation choice** ‚Üí affects gradient flow and nonlinearity
* Trade-off: deeper networks learn complex patterns but are harder to train.

---

## 7. **Gradient Issues**

* **Vanishing gradients** ‚Üí early layers learn slowly (sigmoid/tanh)
* **Exploding gradients** ‚Üí large weight updates, unstable training
* Solutions: ReLU, gradient clipping, proper initialization

---

## 8. **Learning Rate & Schedulers**

* Too high ‚Üí divergence
* Too low ‚Üí slow learning
* Adaptive learning rates or schedulers help training efficiency

---

## 9. **Evaluation Metrics**

* Loss functions guide training, but final model quality is measured via metrics:

  * **Classification:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  * **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, R¬≤
* Always monitor metrics on **validation set**, not just training loss.

---

## 10. **Advanced Concepts (Optional / Later)**

* **Batch normalization** ‚Üí stabilizes and speeds up training
* **Residual connections / skip connections** ‚Üí help very deep networks
* **Convolutional layers / recurrent layers / attention** ‚Üí specialized architectures for images, sequences, and NLP
