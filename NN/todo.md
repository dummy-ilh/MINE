Absolutely — you’ve covered a lot: forward pass, backward pass, activations, loss functions, and their derivatives. But to get a **complete conceptual map of ANNs**, there are still several **key topics/concepts** that are essential to understand modern networks fully. Here’s a structured list:

---

# 📘 Remaining Important Concepts in ANNs

---

## 1. **Weight Initialization**

* Poor initialization can cause:

  * **Vanishing gradients** (too small → slow learning)
  * **Exploding gradients** (too large → unstable learning)
* Common methods:

  * **Xavier/Glorot initialization** (for sigmoid/tanh)
  * **He initialization** (for ReLU/Leaky ReLU)
* Intuition: keeps the variance of activations roughly constant across layers.

---

## 2. **Regularization Techniques**

* Prevent overfitting, especially in large networks:

  * **L1/L2 weight regularization** → penalize large weights
  * **Dropout** → randomly deactivate neurons during training
  * **Early stopping** → stop when validation loss stops improving

---

## 3. **Optimization Algorithms**

* Vanilla gradient descent isn’t always sufficient:

  * **Momentum** → remembers past gradients for smoother convergence
  * **AdaGrad / RMSProp / Adam** → adaptive learning rates per parameter
* Choice of optimizer affects speed and stability of learning.

---

## 4. **Batching**

* Full-batch vs mini-batch vs stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
* Mini-batch is most common; balances **gradient stability** and **training speed**

---

## 5. **Overfitting vs Underfitting**

* Overfitting: low training loss, high validation loss → model memorized data
* Underfitting: high loss on both training and validation → model too simple
* Controlled via regularization, network size, and training duration

---

## 6. **Network Architecture Choices**

* **Number of hidden layers** → depth
* **Number of neurons per layer** → width
* **Activation choice** → affects gradient flow and nonlinearity
* Trade-off: deeper networks learn complex patterns but are harder to train.

---

## 7. **Gradient Issues**

* **Vanishing gradients** → early layers learn slowly (sigmoid/tanh)
* **Exploding gradients** → large weight updates, unstable training
* Solutions: ReLU, gradient clipping, proper initialization

---

## 8. **Learning Rate & Schedulers**

* Too high → divergence
* Too low → slow learning
* Adaptive learning rates or schedulers help training efficiency

---

## 9. **Evaluation Metrics**

* Loss functions guide training, but final model quality is measured via metrics:

  * **Classification:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
  * **Regression:** RMSE, MAE, R²
* Always monitor metrics on **validation set**, not just training loss.

---

## 10. **Advanced Concepts (Optional / Later)**

* **Batch normalization** → stabilizes and speeds up training
* **Residual connections / skip connections** → help very deep networks
* **Convolutional layers / recurrent layers / attention** → specialized architectures for images, sequences, and NLP

If you want, I can **draw a single “complete ANN map”** showing **data flow, activations, loss, gradients, updates, regularization, and common pitfalls**, essentially giving you a **full picture from input to output** for any neural network.

Do you want me to do that next?
