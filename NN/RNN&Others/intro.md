# Why cant ANN be used for textual analysis?
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are generally not the best choice for textual analysis because they lack certain structural features needed to efficiently handle the complexities of text data. ANNs process data in a feed-forward manner without memory of previous inputs or inherent mechanisms to capture sequence and context, which is crucial for understanding texts.

### Key reasons ANNs struggle with textual analysis:
- **No sequence memory:** ANNs do not have feedback or recurrent connections, so they cannot remember previous words or context, which is essential since text is inherently sequential and context-dependent.
- **Data structure mismatch:** Text data is sequential, and semantic understanding requires models that can maintain state across time steps, like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are designed for sequence data. In contrast, ANNs work best with tabular or fixed-size input data.
- **Feature extraction limitations:** ANNs require explicit feature engineering and cannot automatically extract complex features from raw data like text, unlike models with convolutional or recurrent layers that can capture spatial or temporal dependencies.
- **High dimensionality and sparsity:** Text data represented as vectors (e.g., one-hot or embeddings) is often high-dimensional and sparse, which can make ANNs less efficient and effective without specialized architectures.
- **Comparison with other models:** CNNs can handle spatial relationships and parameter sharing, while RNNs have memory to handle sequences; ANNs do not perform well on these fronts for text applications.

# How do RNNs and Transformers handle sequences better
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers handle sequences better than traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their architectural designs that capture contextual dependencies within sequences.

### How RNNs handle sequences:
- RNNs process input sequentially, maintaining a hidden state that acts as a memory of previous inputs in the sequence. This allows the network to capture temporal dependencies and context from earlier elements when processing later ones.
- Specialized RNN units like LSTM and GRU mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, helping the network remember long-range dependencies better.
- The sequential nature means RNNs inherently model order and flow of information in time, which is fundamental for tasks like language modeling and speech recognition.[1][3]

### How Transformers handle sequences:
- Transformers do not process sequences sequentially; instead, they use self-attention mechanisms to relate all elements of a sequence to each other at once, regardless of their position.
- The self-attention mechanism assigns weights to all other tokens when encoding each token, which captures dependencies over long distances more effectively than RNNs.
- Transformers employ positional encodings to inject order information since they lack recurrence, enabling them to handle sequence order while benefiting from parallel processing.
- Multi-head attention enables the model to focus on different aspects of the sequence simultaneously, improving the ability to learn diverse contextual relationships.
- Compared to RNNs, transformers train faster due to parallelization and scale better to large datasets and model sizes.[2][3][1]

### Summary comparison

| Aspect                  | RNN                          | Transformer                     |

| Order modeling          | Natural due to sequence flow | Positional encoding required  |
| Training efficiency     | Slower due to sequentialism | Faster with parallelization    |
| Scalability             | Limited                     | Highly scalable               |
| Typical use             | Speech, language modeling    | Translation, summarization, broad NLP tasks |

This architectural superiority explains why both RNNs and especially Transformers are preferred for textual and sequence-based tasks over traditional ANNs.[3][1][2]
