---

## **1. Oscillations**

🔹 **Definition:** Training loss bounces up and down, doesn’t steadily decrease.

* Looks like “zig-zagging” instead of smooth descent.

🔹 **Causes:**

1. **Learning rate too high** → steps overshoot the minima.
2. **Ill-conditioned loss landscape** (elongated valleys, steep curvature in some directions).
3. **No momentum damping** → gradients keep pushing back and forth.

🔹 **Analogy:** Like rolling a ball in a narrow curved valley → if you step too far sideways, you bounce across instead of rolling down smoothly.

🔹 **Fixes:**

* Lower the learning rate.
* Add **momentum** or use optimizers with momentum terms (Adam, RMSprop).
* Use normalization (BatchNorm, LayerNorm) to stabilize curvature.
* Try adaptive learning rate schedulers.

## **2. Divergence**

🔹 **Definition:** Training completely blows up — loss → ∞ or NaN. Weights explode.

* Unlike oscillations, here the model doesn’t just wobble, it **runs away**.

🔹 **Causes:**

1. **Learning rate far too high** → steps overshoot massively.
2. **Exploding gradients** (esp. RNNs, Transformers without clipping).
3. **Unstable initialization** (poor scaling of weights).
4. **Numerical instability** in loss (e.g., `log(0)` in cross-entropy).

🔹 **Signs:**

* Loss suddenly spikes after being stable.
* Gradient norms explode.
* Parameters become NaN or Inf.

🔹 **Fixes:**

* Reduce learning rate drastically.
* Use **gradient clipping**.
* Switch to a stable loss implementation (e.g., `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` instead of manual log-softmax).
* Check data preprocessing (normalize inputs, avoid NaNs).
* Use better initialization (Xavier, He).

## **3. Oscillations vs Divergence**

| Behavior            | Oscillations                         | Divergence                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Loss curve          | Zig-zag but bounded                  | Blows up to ∞ or NaN                     |
| Cause               | LR slightly too high, poor curvature | LR way too high, exploding gradients     |
| Model still learns? | Sometimes, but inefficient           | No — training fails                      |
| Fix                 | Lower LR, momentum, normalization    | Lower LR, gradient clipping, stable init |

## **4. Practical Debugging Workflow**

If you see weird training curves:

1. **Check LR first**

   * Run an LR finder.
   * Start low, increase until you see instability.

2. **Check gradient norms**

   * If they explode → clip them.

3. **Check loss values**

   * NaN? Then inspect preprocessing, activation saturation, or loss implementation.

✅ **Summary (Interview Answer Style):**

* **Oscillations** happen when the learning rate is slightly too high or the loss surface is badly conditioned — the optimizer keeps bouncing around minima.
* **Divergence** happens when learning rate or gradients are so large that weights explode — the model can’t recover.
* In practice: reduce LR, use momentum/Adam, apply gradient clipping, and ensure stable initialization and loss functions.
