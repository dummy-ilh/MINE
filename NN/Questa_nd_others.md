## 🧠 **Intro to Deep Learning (DL)**

---

**1. What is deep learning, and how is it different from traditional machine learning?**

**Answer:**

* Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that uses **neural networks with multiple layers** to automatically learn hierarchical representations from raw data.
* Unlike traditional ML, which often requires **manual feature engineering**, DL automatically learns features through hidden layers.
* Example: In image classification, DL learns edges → shapes → objects automatically.

---

**2. Explain the universal approximation theorem.**

**Answer:**

* The theorem states that a **feedforward neural network with at least one hidden layer and non-linear activation** can approximate any continuous function on a closed, bounded subset of ℝⁿ, given sufficient neurons.
* Limitation: **It does not guarantee efficient learning** or generalization; practical training may require deep networks and regularization.

---

**3. Why do deep networks work better than shallow ones for some tasks?**

**Answer:**

* Deep networks learn **hierarchical features**, enabling them to represent complex functions efficiently.
* Shallow networks may require exponentially more neurons to approximate the same function.
* Example: In images, shallow networks may struggle to capture high-level patterns like faces, while deep networks capture edges → textures → shapes → faces.

---

## 🔧 **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**

---

**1. What is an ANN? Describe its components.**

**Answer:**

* ANN is a computational model inspired by the brain, consisting of:

  * **Input layer:** Receives raw features
  * **Hidden layers:** Perform non-linear transformations
  * **Output layer:** Produces predictions
  * **Neurons/nodes:** Compute weighted sums + activation function
  * **Weights & biases:** Learnable parameters that adjust the signal
  * **Activation functions:** Introduce non-linearity (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh)

ASCII illustration of a simple 3-layer ANN:

```
Input Layer    Hidden Layer      Output Layer
   x1 ----> (Neuron) ----\
   x2 ----> (Neuron) ----> y_hat
   x3 ----> (Neuron) ----/
```

---

**2. How does forward propagation work in an ANN?**

**Answer:**

1. Compute weighted sum: $z^{[l]} = W^{[l]} a^{[l-1]} + b^{[l]}$
2. Apply activation: $a^{[l]} = f(z^{[l]})$
3. Repeat for all layers until output layer produces $\hat{y}$

**Intuition:** Input passes through each layer, getting transformed into higher-level representations.

---

**3. Explain backpropagation and how gradients are calculated.**

**Answer:**

* Backprop computes **gradient of loss w\.r.t each weight** using the **chain rule**.
* Steps:

  1. Compute **output error**: $\delta^{[L]} = \hat{y} - y$
  2. Propagate error backward: $\delta^{[l]} = (W^{[l+1]})^T \delta^{[l+1]} \cdot f'(z^{[l]})$
  3. Update weights: $W^{[l]} = W^{[l]} - \eta \delta^{[l]} (a^{[l-1]})^T$
* This enables **gradient descent** to minimize the loss.

**4. What are common activation functions and when are they used?**

**Answer:**

| Activation | Usage                      | Properties                                                     |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sigmoid    | Binary outputs             | Smooth, non-linear, saturates at extremes → vanishing gradient |
| Tanh       | Hidden layers              | Zero-centered, better than sigmoid, still saturates            |
| ReLU       | Hidden layers              | Non-linear, efficient, no saturation for positive inputs       |
| Leaky ReLU | Hidden layers              | Solves “dying ReLU” problem by allowing small negative slope   |
| Softmax    | Output layer (multi-class) | Converts logits to probabilities, sum = 1                      |
| Linear     | Output layer (regression)  | Identity function, preserves scale                             |

**5. What is the difference between shallow and deep networks?**

**Answer:**

* **Shallow:** 1 hidden layer; limited capacity; may require many neurons for complex functions
* **Deep:** 2+ hidden layers; learns hierarchical features; can model complex functions efficiently
* Trade-off: deep networks can overfit → need regularization

---

**6. How do you choose the number of hidden layers and neurons?**

**Answer:**

* No strict rule; guided by:

  * Dataset size
  * Task complexity
  * Cross-validation performance
* Heuristics:

  * Start small → increase layers/neurons gradually
  * Use early stopping/regularization to prevent overfitting

---

**7. What are vanishing and exploding gradients, and how can they be mitigated?**

**Answer:**

* **Vanishing gradient:** Gradients shrink → early layers learn slowly. Mitigation: ReLU, He initialization, batch norm, residual connections.
* **Exploding gradient:** Gradients grow → unstable updates. Mitigation: gradient clipping, proper initialization, smaller learning rate.

---

## 🔹 **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**

---

**1. What is an MLP, and how is it different from a general ANN?**

**Answer:**

* MLP is a **fully-connected feedforward ANN**.
* Difference: MLP has no loops, CNNs or RNNs are not MLPs.
* Used for supervised learning: classification or regression.

---

**2. Explain the forward pass in an MLP with an example.**

**Answer:**

* For one hidden layer:

$$
z^{[1]} = W^{[1]} x + b^{[1]}, \quad a^{[1]} = f(z^{[1]})
$$

$$
z^{[2]} = W^{[2]} a^{[1]} + b^{[2]}, \quad \hat{y} = g(z^{[2]})
$$

* **Example (ASCII):**

```
x1 --\
x2 ---> [Hidden Neurons] ---> y_hat
x3 --/
```

---

**3. When would you use an MLP vs another type of neural network?**

**Answer:**

* Use MLP for **tabular data**, simple classification or regression.
* Avoid MLP for **images** (CNN better) or **sequences** (RNN/LSTM better).

---

**4. What loss functions are typically used with MLPs?**

**Answer:**

* **Binary classification:** Binary cross-entropy
* **Multi-class classification:** Categorical cross-entropy
* **Regression:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

**5. How would you prevent overfitting in an MLP?**

**Answer:**

* L1/L2 regularization
* Dropout
* Early stopping
* Increase dataset size or data augmentation

---
