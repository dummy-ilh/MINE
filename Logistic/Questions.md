## **Q1) Why is Logistic Regression called ‚ÄúRegression‚Äù?**

Even though the **output** of logistic regression is *categorical* (e.g., 0 or 1), it‚Äôs still called a **regression** because of *how* it models the relationship between the dependent and independent variables.

Let‚Äôs unpack that carefully.

---

### üîπ 1. Logistic Regression predicts **probabilities**, not classes directly.

We‚Äôre interested in:

[
P(Y = 1 \mid X) = ?
]

We model this probability using a regression-like structure.

---

### üîπ 2. The relationship between inputs and output **is linear in the parameters.**

We start by modeling the **log-odds** (also called the **logit**):

[
\text{logit}(p) = \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \dots + \beta_k X_k
]

Here‚Äôs the key:

* ( p = P(Y = 1 \mid X) )
* The right-hand side (( \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \dots )) is **linear in the parameters** ( \beta_i )
* That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a **regression model**, not a classification rule per se.

---

### üîπ 3. The ‚ÄúRegression‚Äù part refers to estimating **coefficients (( \beta ))**.

Like linear regression, logistic regression:

* Fits coefficients using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**
* Quantifies **how each independent variable affects the dependent variable**

So, logistic regression is **a regression technique for a categorical dependent variable**.

---

### üîπ 4. Contrast with Classification Algorithms

Logistic regression **models probability** via regression of the log-odds,
while classification algorithms like Decision Trees or SVM **directly classify** without fitting a regression-type model.

That‚Äôs the conceptual reason it‚Äôs called ‚Äúregression.‚Äù

---

‚úÖ **In short:**

> Logistic regression is called a regression because it models a linear relationship between predictors and the *log-odds* of the outcome ‚Äî using regression coefficients estimated from data.

---

## **Q2) Is Logistic Regression Linear or Non-Linear?**

This is a subtle but important distinction ‚Äî and often misunderstood.

---

### **Depends on what you mean by ‚Äúlinear.‚Äù**

We can think of linearity in **two senses**:

| Perspective                        | Is Logistic Regression Linear? | Explanation                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **In parameters (( \beta ))**      | ‚úÖ **Yes**                      | The model is linear in coefficients: ( \log\frac{p}{1-p} = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_kX_k ).                |
| **In variables (X) vs output (p)** | ‚ùå **No**                       | The relationship between ( X ) and ( p ) (the predicted probability) is **non-linear** due to the logistic function. |

---

### **Mathematical Breakdown**

[
p = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \cdots + \beta_k X_k)}}
]

* The **inside** of the exponential, ( z = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + ... ), is *linear*.
* But the **final mapping** from ( z ) to ( p ) via the **sigmoid function** is *non-linear*.

That‚Äôs why logistic regression:

* Is **linear in parameters** (regression-like structure)
* But **non-linear in inputs when mapping to probability**

---

### **Graphical Intuition**

If you plot ( X ) vs ( P(Y=1|X) ):

* Linear regression would give a **straight line**, which could go below 0 or above 1 (invalid probabilities).
* Logistic regression gives an **S-shaped curve** (sigmoid), bounded between 0 and 1.

That curve shape comes from the **non-linear transformation** (sigmoid).

# Error / Residuals ‚Äî Linear vs Logistic Regression

## 1) What the ‚Äúerror‚Äù means in each model

**Linear regression**

* Model: (y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \varepsilon).
* Error term: (\varepsilon = y - \hat y) (the residual).
* Assumed distribution: (\varepsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^2)) (i.i.d. Gaussian).
* Variance is constant (homoscedasticity): (\mathrm{Var}(\varepsilon\mid X)=\sigma^2).
* Residuals are used to check assumptions (normality, constant variance, independence).

**Logistic regression**

* Model in logit form: (\text{logit}(p)=\beta_0+\beta_1x), (p=P(Y=1\mid X)).
* There is no additive Gaussian error term on (Y). Instead (Y) is a **Bernoulli** random variable:
  [
  Y\mid X \sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}(p)
  ]
* So the ‚Äúerror‚Äù is the randomness in a Bernoulli draw, not a continuous additive noise.
* Mean and variance:
  [
  \mathbb{E}[Y\mid X]=p,\qquad \mathrm{Var}(Y\mid X)=p(1-p).
  ]
* Variance depends on (p) (heteroscedastic by construction).

---

## 2) Residual definitions and interpretation

**Linear residuals**

* Raw residual: (r_i = y_i - \hat y_i).
* Standardized residual: (r_i^\ast = \dfrac{y_i - \hat y_i}{\hat\sigma\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}}) (accounts for leverage (h_{ii})).
* Residuals should be roughly normal with constant variance if assumptions hold.

**Logistic residuals** ‚Äî several useful types:

* **Raw (response) residual**: (r_i = y_i - \hat p_i). Simple but variance depends on (p_i).
* **Pearson residual**:
  [
  r_{i,\text{Pearson}} = \frac{y_i - \hat p_i}{\sqrt{\hat p_i(1-\hat p_i)}}.
  ]
  This standardizes the residual by the Bernoulli variance.
* **Deviance residual** (commonly used):
  [
  r_{i,\text{dev}} = \operatorname{sign}(y_i-\hat p_i)\sqrt{2\left[y_i\log\frac{y_i}{\hat p_i} + (1-y_i)\log\frac{1-y_i}{1-\hat p_i}\right]}.
  ]
  For binary data this simplifies because (y_i) is 0 or 1; it relates to the contribution of observation (i) to the model deviance (negative twice the log-likelihood ratio).
* These residuals are used for diagnostics (outliers, lack-of-fit), but their distributional interpretation is different from linear case.

---

## 3) Loss function vs likelihood (error measure)

* **Linear regression** minimizes **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** or MSE:
  [
  \text{MSE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_i (y_i-\hat y_i)^2.
  ]
* **Logistic regression** maximizes the **binomial log-likelihood** (equivalently minimizes cross-entropy / log-loss):
  [
  \ell(\beta)=\sum_i \big[y_i\log(\hat p_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-\hat p_i)\big].
  ]
  Negative log-likelihood (per-observation) is the log-loss:
  [
  -\frac{1}{n}\ell(\beta)= -\frac{1}{n}\sum_i \big[y_i\log(\hat p_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-\hat p_i)\big].
  ]

Implication: **MSE is not appropriate** for fitting logistic models (probabilities are bounded and Bernoulli noise structure is different).

---

## 4) Goodness-of-fit & tests based on error

**Linear regression**

* (R^2), adjusted (R^2).
* F-test, t-tests (rely on Gaussian errors).
* Residual diagnostics: QQ-plot of residuals, plot residuals vs fitted for heteroscedasticity.

**Logistic regression**

* Deviance: (D = -2(\text{log-likelihood}*{\text{model}} - \text{log-likelihood}*{\text{saturated}})).

  * Likelihood ratio tests compare nested models via deviance differences (asymptotically (\chi^2)).
* Hosmer‚ÄìLemeshow test (group-based goodness-of-fit).
* Metrics for predictive performance: **log-loss**, **AUC**, **accuracy**, **calibration plots**.
* Residual diagnostics use Pearson or deviance residuals (and influence measures like Cook‚Äôs distance adapted for GLMs).

---

## 5) Heteroscedasticity & variance function

* **Linear regression** assumes constant variance (\sigma^2).
* **Logistic regression** has variance function (V(\mu)=\mu(1-\mu)) (natural for binomial family). Variance changes with predicted probability ‚Äî this is built into the GLM framework, and estimation (MLE) uses that variance structure.

---

## 6) Overdispersion

* For binomial models, observed variance can sometimes exceed the model-implied variance (p(1-p)) ‚Äî called **overdispersion**.
* Overdispersion suggests model misspecification (e.g., unmodelled heterogeneity). Remedies: use quasi-binomial models or add random effects (mixed models).

---

## 7) Practical diagnostics related to errors

* Linear: check residual QQ-plot, residual vs fitted, leverage & influence.
* Logistic:

  * Plot **calibration curve** (observed frequency vs predicted probability).
  * Plot **residuals** (Pearson / deviance) vs fitted values to detect structure.
  * Check **influential observations** with adapted Cook‚Äôs distance or DFBetas for GLMs.
  * Compare models with **Likelihood Ratio Test (LRT)** or AIC rather than SSE-based criteria.

---

## 8) Simple numeric example (illustrative)

Suppose one observation has (y=1) and (\hat p = 0.9).

* Raw residual: (1 - 0.9 = 0.1).
* Pearson residual: (\dfrac{0.1}{\sqrt{0.9\times0.1}} \approx 0.333).
* Deviance contribution:
  [
  2\left[1\cdot\log\frac{1}{0.9} + 0\right] = 2\log\frac{1}{0.9} \approx 0.2107,
  ]
  deviance residual (=\sqrt{0.2107}\approx 0.459).

Interpretation: these standardized residuals give different scales and diagnostics ‚Äî none are the simple normal residuals of linear regression.

---

## 9) Key takeaways (short)

* **Linear regression**: additive Gaussian error (\varepsilon); residuals (y-\hat y); constant variance; use MSE/OLS; residuals ~ normal.
* **Logistic regression**: binomial noise (no additive Gaussian error on (Y)); variance (p(1-p)); use log-likelihood / cross-entropy; residuals are response / Pearson / deviance residuals; variance depends on prediction.
* Diagnostics, goodness-of-fit, and interpretation of residuals are different ‚Äî use GLM-specific tools for logistic regression.
