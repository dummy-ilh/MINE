Here are some of the top recommended textbooks to master logistic regression, based on expert and community recommendations:

| Title | Author(s) | Highlights | Best For |
|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Applied Logistic Regression** (3rd Edition) | David W. Hosmer Jr., Stanley Lemeshow, Rodney X. Sturdivant | Classic and comprehensive coverage of logistic regression theory and applications, extensive examples especially in health sciences, model interpretation, diagnostics, and extensions | Intermediate to advanced readers in health/social sciences and statistics |
| **Practical Guide to Logistic Regression** | Joseph M. Hilbe | Clear explanations, practical examples, emphasis on understanding logistic modeling beyond software, code for R, SAS, Stata | Practitioners wanting a balance of theory and application with software guidance |
| **Logistic Regression: A Primer** | Fred C. Pampel | Accessible introduction with social science focus, clear explanations of logistic coefficients and software implementation | Beginners and social science researchers looking for practical clarity |
| **Best Practices in Logistic Regression** | Jason W. Osborne | Applied approach, emphasizes conceptual understanding, practical application, student-friendly, covers both basics and some advanced topics | Students and analysts looking for clear, practical guidance |
| **Logistic Regression Using SAS: Theory and Application** (2nd Edition) | Paul D. Allison | Detailed SAS implementation guide, includes advanced modeling like multinomial and ordinal logistic regression | SAS users and applied researchers wanting in-depth software guidance |
| **Applied Ordinal Logistic Regression Using Stata** | Xing Liu | Focuses on ordinal logistic and multilevel modeling with Stata software | Researchers working with ordinal data and Stata software |
| **Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variables Using Stata** (3rd Edition) | J. Scott Long, Jeremy Freese | Authoritative guide on categorical data modeling using Stata, covers logistic regression extensively | Stata users seeking a comprehensive reference |

### Summary Recommendations
- **Start with "Applied Logistic Regression" by Hosmer & Lemeshow** if you want a solid, classic foundation with real-world examples.
- **"Practical Guide to Logistic Regression" by Hilbe** offers balanced theory, practical tips, and software code for multiple platforms.
- For software-specific mastery, choose **Paul Allison’s SAS book** or **Xing Liu’s Stata book**.
- Beginners may prefer **Pampel's "Logistic Regression: A Primer"** for gentle yet practical introductions.
- For a more applied teaching style, **Osborne's "Best Practices"** is highly regarded for clarity.
