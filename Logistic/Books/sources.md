Here are some of the top recommended textbooks to master logistic regression, based on expert and community recommendations:

| Title | Author(s) | Highlights | Best For |
|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| **Applied Logistic Regression** (3rd Edition) | David W. Hosmer Jr., Stanley Lemeshow, Rodney X. Sturdivant | Classic and comprehensive coverage of logistic regression theory and applications, extensive examples especially in health sciences, model interpretation, diagnostics, and extensions | Intermediate to advanced readers in health/social sciences and statistics |
| **Practical Guide to Logistic Regression** | Joseph M. Hilbe | Clear explanations, practical examples, emphasis on understanding logistic modeling beyond software, code for R, SAS, Stata | Practitioners wanting a balance of theory and application with software guidance |
| **Logistic Regression: A Primer** | Fred C. Pampel | Accessible introduction with social science focus, clear explanations of logistic coefficients and software implementation | Beginners and social science researchers looking for practical clarity |
| **Best Practices in Logistic Regression** | Jason W. Osborne | Applied approach, emphasizes conceptual understanding, practical application, student-friendly, covers both basics and some advanced topics | Students and analysts looking for clear, practical guidance |
| **Logistic Regression Using SAS: Theory and Application** (2nd Edition) | Paul D. Allison | Detailed SAS implementation guide, includes advanced modeling like multinomial and ordinal logistic regression | SAS users and applied researchers wanting in-depth software guidance |
| **Applied Ordinal Logistic Regression Using Stata** | Xing Liu | Focuses on ordinal logistic and multilevel modeling with Stata software | Researchers working with ordinal data and Stata software |
| **Regression Models for Categorical and Limited Dependent Variables Using Stata** (3rd Edition) | J. Scott Long, Jeremy Freese | Authoritative guide on categorical data modeling using Stata, covers logistic regression extensively | Stata users seeking a comprehensive reference |

### Summary Recommendations
- **Start with "Applied Logistic Regression" by Hosmer & Lemeshow** if you want a solid, classic foundation with real-world examples.
- **"Practical Guide to Logistic Regression" by Hilbe** offers balanced theory, practical tips, and software code for multiple platforms.
- For software-specific mastery, choose **Paul Allison’s SAS book** or **Xing Liu’s Stata book**.
- Beginners may prefer **Pampel's "Logistic Regression: A Primer"** for gentle yet practical introductions.
- For a more applied teaching style, **Osborne's "Best Practices"** is highly regarded for clarity.

Here are some of the **top textbooks** & resources to master *logistic regression*, along with their strengths, what level they suit, and how they can help you deeply understand both theory and practice. If you tell me whether you prefer more math, applied, or a specific domain (ML / biostat / social sciences), I can tailor further.
