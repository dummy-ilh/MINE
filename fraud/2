This invention introduces a fraud detection system that provides a first line of defense against fraudulent transactions. It works by dynamically calculating all possible sums of transaction multiples and comparing these sums to new incoming bill amounts. If the new bill amount does not match a valid sum, it is flagged as potentially fraudulent. Unlike traditional fraud detection methods, which rely on historical data or machine learning, this system uses real-time calculations for immediate transaction verification. Its adaptability to different transaction environments makes it an effective and scalable solution for preventing fraud across industries.
**Patent Write-up for Fraud Detection System**

This invention provides a novel fraud detection system that works by evaluating transaction bills using dynamic calculations of multiples and sums derived from previous transactions or predefined values. When a new transaction amount is inputted, the system calculates all possible sums of these multiples (e.g., x + y, x + 2y, etc.), then compares these sums to the incoming bill amount. If the new bill is not a valid sum, it is flagged as potentially fraudulent. 

The uniqueness of this system lies in its ability to dynamically compute and validate sums across multiple possible combinations, a significant departure from traditional methods that rely solely on historical spending patterns or machine learning models. Unlike existing fraud detection systems that primarily focus on analyzing historical data for patterns, this method ensures real-time, rule-based validation of transaction amounts, significantly enhancing security and providing immediate feedback on transaction legitimacy. This technique also offers scalability and flexibility, making it adaptable for a variety of transaction environments, from online payments to point-of-sale systems, ensuring broader applicability and more efficient fraud detection across industries.
