This invention introduces a fraud detection system that provides a first line of defense against fraudulent transactions. It works by dynamically calculating all possible sums of transaction multiples and comparing these sums to new incoming bill amounts. If the new bill amount does not match a valid sum, it is flagged as potentially fraudulent. Unlike traditional fraud detection methods, which rely on historical data or machine learning, this system uses real-time calculations for immediate transaction verification. Its adaptability to different transaction environments makes it an effective and scalable solution for preventing fraud across industries.
