## **1. Goals & Design Principles**

**Technical / Legal Description:**
The primary objective of the system is to automatically derive, formalize, and audit communication policies from a corpus of financial institution emails, including cases not fully addressed by existing rules. The system aims to produce a minimal, robust, and traceable policy set that:

1. Represents policies as **geometric regions in semantic space** rather than unstructured text summaries.
2. Anchors policies on both **core examples** (typical communications) and **boundary examples** (edge-case or grey-area communications).
3. Outputs both **human-readable policy statements** and **machine-executable conditional rules**.
4. Provides a reproducible and auditable process, explicitly identifying communications not covered by any derived policy.
5. Applies a **single controlled generalization pass** to combine compatible policies while avoiding overgeneralization.

**Layman Explanation:**
The system’s goal is to turn a messy collection of emails into a clear, minimal rulebook. It does this by finding clusters of similar messages, defining rules around the centers and edges of these clusters, and ensuring that each rule can be traced back to the emails that inspired it. Only one careful merging pass is allowed to combine rules, preventing overly broad policies.

---

## **2. Background & Motivation**

**Technical / Legal Description:**
In financial institutions, compliance teams rely on pre-existing rules to monitor internal and client communications. However, grey-area communications—where existing rules are ambiguous or silent—pose regulatory and operational risks. Conventional methods for deriving new policies directly from text are insufficient because they:

1. Lack formal structure to ensure coverage and traceability.
2. Produce rules that may overgeneralize or undergeneralize.
3. Are not reproducible and cannot be audited efficiently.

The present system addresses these limitations by generating **boundary-anchored policies**, compressing overlapping rules, and explicitly tracking residual communications.

**Layman Explanation:**
Banks already have rulebooks, but some emails fall into ambiguous situations. Simply reading emails or asking AI to “make rules” is risky because it can miss important nuances or invent overly broad rules. This system creates rules that are **structured, traceable, and auditable**.

---

## **3. High-Level Pipeline / Architecture Overview**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

The system comprises the following sequential steps:

1. **Embedding:** Convert each email into a semantic vector using a pre-defined embedding function.
2. **Clustering:** Group vectors into clusters using density-based methods; identify noise/outliers.
3. **Boundary Extraction:** Determine core and boundary exemplars within each cluster.
4. **Candidate Policy Drafting:** Generate candidate policies constrained by core and boundary examples.
5. **Coverage Computation:** Apply candidate policies to all emails to evaluate coverage.
6. **Minimal Policy Set Extraction (MPSE):** Select a minimal subset of policies maximizing coverage.
7. **One-Round Controlled Generalization:** Merge compatible policies in a single pass, constrained by negative examples.
8. **Final Outputs:** Produce a policy handbook, coverage map, traceability map, and residual email list.

**Layman Explanation:**
Think of it like mapping a city: each email is a house on a map. We group houses into neighborhoods, look at the central and edge houses to define neighborhood rules, check which houses follow which rules, compress overlapping rules, carefully merge compatible neighborhoods once, and then produce a clear atlas with a list of houses not yet assigned to any neighborhood.

---

## **4. Formalization / Theoretical Foundations**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

**Inputs:**

* Email corpus: $D = \{e_1, e_2, \dots, e_n\}$
* Embedding function: $\phi: \text{text} \to \mathbb{R}^d$
* Semantic vectors: $V = \{v_i = \phi(e_i)\}$

**Clustering & Density:**

* Use a density-based clustering algorithm (e.g., HDBSCAN or OPTICS) to generate clusters $\mathcal{C} = \{C_1, \dots, C_k\}$ and a noise set $N$.
* Compute pointwise density $\rho(v_i)$ for each vector.

**Core / Boundary / Outlier Definitions:**

* Thresholds $\tau_{\text{core}} > \tau_{\text{bound}}$
* Core: $\text{Core}_j = \{v \in C_j \,|\, \rho(v) \ge \tau_{\text{core}}\}$
* Boundary: $\text{Bound}_j = \{v \in C_j \,|\, \tau_{\text{bound}} \le \rho(v) < \tau_{\text{core}}\}$
* Outliers: $N \cup \{v \in C_j \,|\, \rho(v) < \tau_{\text{bound}}\}$

**Policy Regions:**

* For cluster $C_j$, define $R_j \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ as the concave hull or alpha-shape enclosing Core and Boundary vectors.
* New vector $v$ is considered covered if $v \in R_j$ or $\text{distance}(v, R_j) \le \epsilon$.

**Candidate Policy Mapping:**

* $T(R_j, A_j) \to P_j$, where $A_j$ = set of textual anchors.
* Output: dual representation (NL statement + IF–THEN executable rule), constrained by Core + Boundary examples.

**Layman Explanation:**
Every email is converted into a point in a multi-dimensional space. Clusters show groups of similar emails. The heart of a cluster defines the typical behavior, edges define tricky cases, and outliers are ignored for now. Policies are drawn as **shapes around these points**, and rules are written using both the center and the edges to make them precise but not too broad.

Great! Here are **Sections 5–8** in the same formal, lawyer-ready style, with layman explanations included:

## **5. Agent Architecture & Roles**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

The system is composed of specialized agents orchestrating distinct functional responsibilities:

1. **Embedder:** Computes semantic embeddings of emails using a pre-defined model.
2. **Cluster Agent:** Performs density-based clustering, computes core/boundary sets, and constructs geometric regions $R_j$.
3. **Drafting Agent:** Uses core and boundary textual anchors to generate candidate policies $P_j$ (human-readable + IF–THEN rules) and proposes negative examples.
4. **Coverage Agent:** Evaluates the applicability of each candidate policy across all emails, producing a coverage matrix.
5. **Compression / MPSE Agent:** Executes greedy set-cover selection to identify a minimal policy subset; proposes potential merges.
6. **Generalization Agent:** Performs one-round policy merges, constrained by negative anchors, and outputs revised policies and classifiers.
7. **Supervisor:** Enforces one-round merge limits and acceptance criteria; ensures reproducibility and auditability.
8. **Audit Agent:** Generates final deliverables: policy handbook, coverage map, residuals, traceability map, and rationale logs.

**Inter-Agent Constraints:**

* Deterministic time-bound operations, fixed random seeds, and bounded generalization ensure reproducibility.
* Negative anchors are explicitly enforced during merge operations.

**Layman Explanation:**
Each agent is like a specialized worker in a bank’s compliance team: one maps emails, one identifies neighborhoods, one drafts rules, another checks which emails follow which rules, another merges overlapping rules, and a supervisor ensures everything is done carefully and reproducibly. The audit agent produces the final report for regulators.

---

## **6. Candidate Policy Drafting**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

* For each cluster $C_j$, the Drafting Agent generates candidate policies $P_j$ using:

  1. **Core Anchors:** Representative emails within the cluster’s center.
  2. **Boundary Anchors:** Edge-case emails defining cluster limits.
  3. **Negative Anchors:** Emails explicitly outside the cluster.

* Output:

  * Human-readable policy statement.
  * Machine-executable IF–THEN predicate.
  * Negative examples for testing overgeneralization.

* Prompts enforce that the policy respects the boundary anchors and avoids coverage of negative anchors.

**Layman Explanation:**
For each neighborhood, we ask the AI to write a rule: “This rule applies to these houses (core) and should include edge houses (boundary), but not these other houses (negative examples).” The AI provides both a human-readable rule and a machine-checkable version.

---

## **7. Minimal Policy Set Extraction (MPSE)**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

* Define coverage set for each candidate policy:
  $\text{cover}(P_j) = \{e_i \in D : v_i \in R_j\}$

* Objective: identify minimal subset $S \subseteq \{P_j\}$ maximizing coverage.

* Algorithm:

  1. Initialize $S = \emptyset$.
  2. Iteratively select policy with maximal coverage of uncovered emails.
  3. Stop when additional policies add negligible new coverage or reach a preset limit $K_\text{max}$.

* Merge proposals: evaluate pairs/triples of policies for potential combination based on semantic region overlap and coverage gain.

**Layman Explanation:**
We don’t want dozens of overlapping rules. MPSE selects the **fewest number of rules** that cover most emails. If two rules are very similar and can be safely combined, we propose merging them.

---

## **8. One-Round Controlled Generalization**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

* Merge candidates are evaluated by the Generalization Agent using core, boundary, and negative anchors.

* Acceptance criteria enforced by Supervisor:

  1. Merged policy increases overall coverage by at least $\alpha$.
  2. False inclusion of negative anchors ≤ $\beta$.
  3. Only a single merge pass is allowed (one-round constraint).

* Output: final policy set $S^*$ with traceable anchors and dual outputs (NL + IF–THEN).

* Metrics such as **Generalization Index (coverage gain / semantic expansion)** guide merge ranking.

**Layman Explanation:**
After drafting, we carefully try to combine rules **once** to simplify the rulebook. We only merge if it clearly improves coverage without incorrectly including emails that shouldn’t be covered. This keeps rules precise, reproducible, and auditable.

---
Perfect! Here are **Sections 9–12** in the same formal, lawyer-ready style, with layman explanations:

---

## **9. Metrics**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

To evaluate policy quality and coverage, the system measures:

1. **Coverage Percentage (Cov%)** – proportion of emails covered by final policies.
2. **Residual Count** – number of emails not assigned to any policy.
3. **Policy Cardinality (|S*|)*\* – number of policies in the final set.
4. **Overlap Rate** – fraction of emails covered by more than one policy.
5. **Anchor Traceability Ratio** – fraction of policies with adequate core and boundary anchors for auditing.
6. **Generalization Index (GI)** – ratio of coverage gain to semantic expansion during merges.
7. **False Inclusion Rate** – fraction of negative anchors incorrectly included by a policy.

**Layman Explanation:**
We measure how many emails are covered, how many rules exist, how often emails fall under multiple rules, whether each rule can be traced back to examples, and whether merges added coverage without mistakes.

---

## **10. Complexity Analysis & LLM Call Budgeting**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

* **Embedding:** O(n·d), where n = number of emails, d = embedding dimension.
* **Clustering:** O(n log n) for HDBSCAN/OPTICS.
* **Candidate Drafting:** One LLM call per cluster (k ≈ 10–50).
* **Coverage Computation:** O(k·n).
* **MPSE / Greedy Selection:** O(k·n).
* **Merge Proposals / One-Round Generalization:** M LLM calls (10–30).
* **Total LLM Calls:** Approximately 30–50, ensuring computational feasibility and cost control.

**Layman Explanation:**
The system is designed to handle hundreds of emails efficiently. Most AI calls are done **once per cluster**, and only a small number of careful merges are performed, keeping processing time and cost reasonable.

---

## **11. Example Use Case (500 Emails)**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

* Input: 500 emails from a bank’s internal communications.
* Clustering: 18 clusters identified, plus 60 noise/outliers.
* Drafting: Candidate policies generated for each cluster with 4–8 core and 2–4 boundary anchors.
* MPSE: Greedy selection reduces to 9 policies (76% coverage).
* One-round generalization: 12 merge candidates evaluated; 3 merges accepted → final 6 policies (84% coverage).
* Residuals: 80 emails flagged for human review.
* Outputs: Policy Handbook, Coverage Map, Traceability Map, Residual List.

**Layman Explanation:**
From 500 emails, the system produces **6 clear rules** covering most emails, plus a list of 80 tricky emails for humans to check. Each rule is tied to specific example emails and carefully drafted boundaries.

---

## **12. Deliverables / Outputs**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

1. **Policy Handbook:** Human-readable NL statements and IF–THEN rules, severity tags, rationale.

4. **Residual List:** Prioritized list of uncovered emails.
5. **Merge Rationale Log:** Documentation of each accepted merge, anchors used, and LLM prompts.
6. **Versioning / Reproducibility:** Deterministic seeds, agent logs, and reproducible runs.

**Layman Explanation:**
The system delivers a **full rulebook**, a map showing which email follows which rule, a log of tricky emails, and detailed notes on why and how rules were merged. Everything is reproducible and auditable.

---
Perfect! Here are **Sections 13–16** in the same formal, lawyer-ready style, with layman explanations:

---

## **13. Novelty & Patentable Elements**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

The system incorporates multiple interconnected innovations:

1. **Policies as Geometric Regions:** Policies are formalized as **semantic-space regions (hulls/alpha-shapes)** rather than free-text summaries.
2. **Boundary Anchoring:** Each policy uses both **core and boundary examples** to constrain generalization.
3. **Minimal Policy Set Extraction (MPSE):** Candidate policies are compressed via a **greedy set-cover algorithm**, minimizing policy count while maximizing coverage.
4. **One-Round Controlled Generalization:** Policies are merged **once** under strict constraints, ensuring reproducibility and avoidance of overgeneralization.
5. **Dual Anchors and Audit Trail:** Each policy is linked to **semantic regions and textual anchors**, with logs of all LLM prompts, decisions, and seeds.
6. **Residual Tracking:** Explicit identification of communications not covered by any policy.

**Layman Explanation:**
Unlike simply asking AI to “make rules,” this system produces **rules you can test mathematically, trace to real emails, compress intelligently, and merge carefully once**. It’s structured, auditable, and reproducible — key differentiators for regulatory and patent purposes.

---

## **14. Failure Modes & Mitigations**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

1. **Overgeneralization:** Mitigated using boundary and negative anchors; supervisor rejects unsafe merges.
2. **Undercoverage:** MPSE ensures high coverage; residuals flagged for human review.
3. **Cluster Fragmentation:** Tuned clustering parameters and adjacency-based merge proposals.
4. **LLM Hallucination:** Drafting Agent constrained to anchors; Audit Agent verifies policies against examples.
5. **Non-Reproducibility:** Deterministic seeds, time-bounded agents, and archived logs.

**Layman Explanation:**
Potential problems like rules being too broad, missing important emails, or AI inventing unsupported rules are controlled through boundaries, careful merges, and audits. Everything is reproducible.

---

## **15. Layman Narrative / Storytelling Section**

**Step-by-Step Layman Description:**

1. **Mapping Emails:** Each email is converted into a “point on a map” where similar emails cluster together.
2. **Identifying Edges:** Core examples show typical behavior; boundary examples show grey areas.
3. **Drafting Rules:** AI drafts rules using these anchors, producing both human-readable and machine-checkable versions.
4. **Compressing Rules:** Overlapping or redundant rules are compressed to a minimal set using a formal algorithm.
5. **One-Round Merge:** Rules are merged **once** only if safe, carefully avoiding covering wrong emails.
6. **Audit & Traceability:** Every rule is traceable to the exact emails that inspired it, with reproducible results.

**Analogy:**
Think of the system as drawing **neighborhood boundaries on a city map** of emails, pinning flags at the edges, compressing overlapping neighborhoods into fewer, clearer zones, and providing a full guide showing which house belongs to which zone and which houses need manual inspection.

## **16. Optional / Next Steps / Visualizations**

**Technical / Legal Description:**

1. **Pseudocode & Algorithmic Description:** For clustering, MPSE, merge evaluation, and one-round generalization.
2. **Mock Dataset & Sample Policies:** To illustrate anchor selection, coverage, and final policies.
3. **Patent Claim Drafting:** Emphasizing boundary anchoring, MPSE, one-round generalization, and auditability.
4. **Flowcharts & Diagrams:** Sequence diagrams, pipeline diagrams, and geometric region visualizations for filing or internal review.

**Layman Explanation:**
Next steps include **showing exactly how the system works step by step**, giving example rules from a sample set of emails, drafting legal claims for patent protection, and drawing diagrams that make the process visually clear.
