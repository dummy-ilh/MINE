# 🚀 Smart Agile Project Management Platform  
**From scattered requests to sprint-ready backlogs — powered end-to-end by GPT-4o.**

---

## 🧠 Problem

Teams are flooded with messy input:
- Product ideas in **emails**  
- Bugs and feedback in **Jira tickets**  
- Requirements in **Zoom call transcripts**  
- New features discussed on **Slack or Notion**

But these inputs are:
- ❌ Unstructured  
- ❌ Lacking context  
- ❌ Disconnected from past efforts  
- ❌ Unaware of your stack, team, and goals

Existing AI tools just summarize or generate vague plans — they don’t **understand your org**, and they don't plan like your best PM or tech lead.

---

## ✅ Solution

> An **AI-native planning engine** built on **GPT-4o**, that **ingests raw communication** from across your org and transforms it into **context-aware, executable, governed Agile plans**.

This isn’t just task generation — it’s **true AI/ML-led planning** using:
- 🧠 **GPT-4o for natural language intelligence**
- 📚 **Org memory via vector search on emails, tickets, code**
- 🔮 **ML-based estimation, velocity forecasting, and risk modeling**
- 🔗 **Strategic alignment and code-level awareness**

---

## 🔁 Workflow: From Inputs to Execution

| **Stage** | **Input** | **AI/ML Engine** | **Output** |
|-----------|-----------|------------------|------------|
| **1. Ingest** | Emails, Jira issues, Zoom transcripts, Notion docs | GPT-4o + Whisper + Vision | Extracted structured idea + metadata |
| **2. Understand** | Extracted brief | GPT-4o + FAISS + embeddings of org history | Link to relevant past work, code modules, teams |
| **3. Plan** | Mapped idea | GPT-4o (function-calling) + graph memory | Detailed epics, user stories, tasks, dependencies |
| **4. Govern** | Draft backlog | GPT-4o + strategy vector space | Scored alignment to OKRs, priorities, risks |
| **5. Allocate** | Team capacity + skills + past sprints | ML (XGBoost, velocity model) | Auto assignment, effort estimation, timing |
| **6. Review & Ship** | Final backlog | GPT-4o Copilot + human approval | Sprint-ready plan, linked to Jira, Notion, GitHub |

---

## 🧠 What Makes It Smart

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 💬 **Multi-modal Input Handling** | Ingests Zoom transcripts, emails, Jira issues, Slack messages |
| 🧠 **GPT-4o-Powered Context Reasoning** | Uses GPT-4o to interpret, extract, and reason across documents |
| 🧭 **Code-Stack Awareness** | Learns what’s feasible for *your* backend, frontend, services |
| 🧮 **ML-based Effort & Velocity Modeling** | Predicts time and team allocation based on past throughput |
| 🎯 **OKR-Driven Governance** | Every task tied to measurable business or technical objective |
| 🔄 **Memory & Reuse** | Finds relevant past features, PRs, modules to avoid duplication |
| 🧑‍💻 **Developer Copilot** | Chat UI to plan, slice, assign, and refactor tasks collaboratively |

---

## 🧪 Sample Use Case

### 🎯 Input:
> "We need to enable multilingual support like competitors. Check if feasible this quarter. Discussed in last week's Zoom + John emailed some ideas."

### 🧠 Platform Workflow:
- Parses **Zoom transcript** + **email** → merges into a structured feature brief
- Uses vector search to find **2023 attempt (blocked by backend limits)**
- Detects that current architecture now allows it (from recent PRs)
- Generates **cross-functional epics**: backend refactor, UI toggles, i18n libraries
- Assigns to relevant engineers based on **past module ownership**
- Links to **"Global Reach" Q2 OKR** and auto-sets priority score
- Forecasts 2-sprint delivery based on team velocity model

### ✅ Output:
Shippable, governed, risk-aware backlog pushed directly to **Jira**.
