Got it. Let's first design a **richer, multi-layered siloed dataset (Example Set 2)**, adding more **levels of data complexity** to make the pain of silos very clear for your session.

---

# **🔹 Example Set 2 – Client & Advisor Communication (Multi-Level, Intense Version)**

We now have **4 different silos** holding related data but **no connections between them**.

---

## **📂 Silo A – CRM Data (Clients & Advisors)**

*(Structured data about client relationships)*

| Client ID | Client Name | Advisor ID | Advisor Name  | Segment     | Contract Tier | Region |
| --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ------ |
| C101      | Alice Wong  | A501       | David Smith   | Wealth Mgmt | Gold          | APAC   |
| C102      | Carl Reyes  | A502       | Sarah Johnson | Retirement  | Silver        | EMEA   |
| C103      | Bob Allen   | A501       | David Smith   | Home Loans  | Bronze        | NA     |
| C104      | Maria Evans | A503       | Linda Brown   | Insurance   | Platinum      | APAC   |

---

## **📂 Silo B – Email & Chat Interactions (Unstructured)**

*(Client communications stored separately in email servers)*

| Interaction ID | Client Email                          | Channel | Subject                   | Date       | Keywords          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------- |
| I201           | [alice@xyz.com](mailto:alice@xyz.com) | Email   | Pricing Clarification     | 2025-07-05 | pricing, discount |
| I202           | [alice@xyz.com](mailto:alice@xyz.com) | Chat    | Product Upgrade Options   | 2025-07-09 | upgrade, premium  |
| I203           | [bob@abc.com](mailto:bob@abc.com)     | Email   | Loan Repayment Query      | 2025-07-07 | repayment, due    |
| I204           | [maria@qrs.com](mailto:maria@qrs.com) | Chat    | Portfolio Diversification | 2025-07-11 | investment, risk  |

---

## **📂 Silo C – Product Catalog & Policy Details**

*(Stored in a separate internal system)*

| Product ID | Product Name      | Category        | Max Tier | Associated Risks       |
| ---------- | ----------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------- |
| P901       | Premium Insurance | Insurance       | Platinum | Policy Lapse, Misclaim |
| P902       | Retirement Plan   | Pension Funds   | Gold     | Market Fluctuation     |
| P903       | Home Loan         | Lending         | Silver   | Default Risk           |
| P904       | Wealth Portfolio  | Investment Mgmt | Platinum | Market Volatility      |

---

## **📂 Silo D – Complaints & Issue Tracking**

*(Separate ticketing tool not linked to CRM or emails)*

| Case ID | Client ID | Issue Summary              | Severity | Status  | Raised On  |
| ------- | --------- | -------------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| T701    | C101      | Overcharged on premium fee | High     | Pending | 2025-07-10 |
| T702    | C104      | Delay in fund allocation   | Medium   | Open    | 2025-07-12 |
| T703    | C102      | Incorrect retirement calc  | High     | Closed  | 2025-07-08 |

## **❌ Problems in Silo Setup:**

* **Data is disconnected:**

  * Emails → Know about "upgrade requests" but don't know **tier or advisor**.
  * CRM → Knows about "Gold tier" but not **who emailed about upgrade**.
  * Complaints → Exist in a ticket system with **no direct link to emails or advisors**.
  * Products → Are disconnected from client interactions and complaints.

* **Business question impossible to answer:**

> *“Which **Gold-tier clients in APAC** requested an **upgrade via email**, have **complaints pending**, and are linked to **Product Premium Insurance**?”*

* This would require **4 manual lookups across 4 silos**, and you'd still miss hidden links.

---

✅ **Next Step:** If you approve this **multi-level dataset**, I’ll design a **Knowledge Graph view** of this same data:

* Entities → Clients, Advisors, Products, Emails, Complaints
* Relationships → *"has\_advisor"*, *"sent\_email"*, *"raised\_ticket"*, *"linked\_to\_product"*
* The KG will **visually show how all 4 silos merge into a single, queryable network**.

Would you like me to **lock this dataset as final** and then prepare a **“Knowledge Graph visualization”** for your session (using the above exact data)?
