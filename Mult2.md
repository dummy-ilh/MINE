## **Problem Statement**

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs frame this clearly for your **problem statement**. I‚Äôll structure it professor-style, but also keep it sharp for a paper or pitch.

### Problem Statement

The explosion of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a **proliferation of options**: GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5, Gemini 1.5, Mistral, Llama-3, and many others. Each model differs in **capabilities, latency, cost, and robustness to domain-specific jargon**.

Currently, **benchmarking results are the only available guide** for model selection. These benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, GSM-8K, HELM, BigBench) are trained and evaluated on *generic or academic datasets*. While informative for broad comparisons, they **fail to capture real-world performance in specialized contexts** such as **banking, legal compliance, or healthcare**, where:

* Industry-specific jargon dominates (e.g., *Basel III, SR-11/7 compliance, derivatives hedging*).
* Errors can be costly (misclassification in regulatory compliance ‚Üí financial penalties).
* Latency and cost trade-offs matter (10 models √ó 1 million queries = prohibitive cost).

This creates a **critical gap**: organizations are forced to make high-stakes decisions about which model to deploy **without reliable, context-sensitive evidence**. Selecting ‚Äúthe best‚Äù model is nontrivial because:

1. **One model is rarely best across all tasks** (Claude may excel at reasoning, GPT-4o at multilinguals, Mistral at speed).
2. **Exhaustive evaluation is infeasible** (evaluating N models √ó M samples incurs prohibitive costs).
3. **Benchmark generalization is weak** ‚Äî models performing well on academic datasets often **fail in real-world jargon-heavy environments**.

Hence, there is an **urgent need for a smart model selection framework** that can:

* Rapidly eliminate weak candidates,
* Adaptively allocate evaluation resources,
* Select the most suitable model for **specific enterprise datasets**, rather than relying on generic leaderboards.

**‚ÄúSelecting the best LLM for domain-specific tasks is challenging because generic benchmarks fail in specialized contexts (e.g., banking with jargon), and exhaustively testing 20+ models on millions of examples is infeasible ‚Äî we propose a smart selection framework that identifies the best model with minimal experimentation.‚Äù**

## **Abstract**

We propose a novel framework, **Smart LLM Selection with Early Elimination and Bandit Optimization**, to efficiently identify the best-performing LLMs for downstream tasks while minimizing inference cost. Instead of querying all models across the entire dataset (e.g., 10 models √ó 1M examples), our approach first uses **progressive partitioning** to filter out weak models on small benchmark subsets. Surviving models are then evaluated using a **multi-armed bandit strategy**, where model-query allocations adaptively focus on models demonstrating superior performance. This two-stage process achieves substantial reductions in computation (e.g., testing only \~20% of queries) while maintaining competitive accuracy. We illustrate our method with an example where only 3 out of 10 models survive early filtering, and bandit optimization further identifies the single best model with less than 30% of the full evaluation cost. The proposed framework offers a scalable and principled solution for LLM selection, suitable for real-world applications where budget and time constraints are critical.

üëâ Do you want me to also add a **concrete running example** (like ‚Äú10 models √ó 1M examples ‚Üí reduced to 3 models √ó 200k examples ‚Üí final best model‚Äù) directly inside the abstract, so it feels more applied?
