# Smart LLM Selection with Early Elimination and Bandit Optimization

---

## **Problem Statement**

The rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs)—including OpenAI GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Anthropic Claude 3.5, Mistral, LLaMA, Cohere Command R+, and others—offers practitioners a wide range of powerful tools. However, selecting the most suitable model for a specific downstream task (e.g., complaint classification in banking, regulatory compliance, or domain-heavy jargon contexts) remains a critical challenge.

Most evaluations today rely on **general-purpose benchmarks** such as MMLU, HELM, or ARC. While these benchmarks provide useful insights, they are **insufficient for specialized domains** (like finance, healthcare, or legal), where task-specific terminology and edge-case reasoning dominate.

The brute-force approach—evaluating **N models across M tasks with full dataset experiments (N × M runs)**—is computationally prohibitive. For instance, testing **20 models on 1M+ records = 20M= runs** would demand massive compute and time budgets, making it infeasible in production.

Thus, there exists a pressing need for a **data-efficient, adaptive, and intelligent framework** that can rapidly narrow down from many models to the best-performing candidate with minimal experimentation.

## **Abstract**

This work introduces a novel framework for **smart LLM selection** that combines **early elimination** with **bandit-based optimization** to identify the most effective model for a downstream task using **minimal experiments**. Instead of exhaustively evaluating all models across the full dataset, our approach leverages a **multi-armed bandit strategy with dropout**, progressively eliminating underperforming models after only a few trials.

The system begins with a **pool of 20+ candidate LLMs** (e.g., GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5, Mistral, Cohere Command R+, LLaMA variants). Through adaptive exploration, the framework prioritizes models that demonstrate promising early performance on representative subsets of task data. Poorly performing models are **dropped early**, while resources are focused on refining confidence intervals for the leading contenders.

By integrating **exploration-exploitation trade-offs**, the framework drastically reduces the computational overhead of LLM selection. For example, rather than running **20 × 1M = 20M evaluations**, the system converges to the top model(s) within a fraction of trials, making **LLM selection feasible for industry-scale applications**.

We demonstrate how this method outperforms static benchmarks in domains like **banking complaint classification**, where jargon-rich data challenges general-purpose evaluations. Our results suggest that **adaptive selection pipelines** can serve as a practical standard for enterprises to identify the best LLMs without excessive compute costs.

## **Layman Explanation**
We are solving the problem of choosing the best AI language model (like GPT, Claude, LLaMA, etc.) for a specific task without having to run huge numbers of expensive tests on all of them. Normally, you might need to test millions of examples across 20 or more models, which is impractical in real-world industries like banking where jargon and special rules exist. Our method uses a smart “early elimination” approach combined with techniques like bandit optimization, so we can quickly rule out weak models after just a few trials and focus only on the promising ones. This makes model selection much faster, cheaper, and more practical in specialized domains.

Understood — here’s a focused, compact **Background** section that keeps exactly to the point you gave and expands it just enough for clarity and use in a paper or patent filing.

## 1. Background

Running all $N$ candidate LLMs on a dataset of $D$ examples incurs a computational cost proportional to

$$
\mathcal{O}(N \times D),
$$

since each example must be processed by every model for a full comparative evaluation. When $N$ and $D$ are large (e.g., tens of models and millions of examples), this brute-force approach becomes prohibitively expensive in terms of latency, monetary API/GPU cost, and operational complexity.

Ensemble methods and full cross-model evaluations provide robustness and can improve aggregate accuracy, but they also multiply inference cost and frequently introduce **redundant** computations: many models produce identical or near-identical outputs on “easy” or low-entropy examples, so running every model on every example wastes resources without improving decision quality.

Our approach reduces this redundancy through two complementary mechanisms:

* **Probabilistic early dropping.** A small, carefully chosen subset of examples (representative and low-entropy “easy” cases) is used to identify and eliminate models that demonstrably fail simple inputs. By removing clearly weak models early, we avoid performing expensive inference with them on the remainder of the dataset.

* **Adaptive reward-guided assignment.** Remaining candidate models are treated as arms in a reward-driven multi-armed bandit. The system dynamically allocates incoming examples to models based on observed rewards (e.g., correctness, calibrated confidence, and cost tradeoffs), balancing exploration and exploitation so that computational budget is concentrated on the most promising models rather than spent uniformly.

Together these mechanisms change the effective cost from $\mathcal{O}(N\times D)$ to a near-linear form where a small up-front cost for screening plus adaptive evaluation of a much smaller survivor set dominates:

$$
\mathcal{O}(k\times N) + \mathcal{O}(M' \times D'),
$$

with $k \ll D$ (screen size) and $M' \ll N$ (survivor models). This substantially reduces redundant evaluation while preserving—or even improving—the accuracy and reliability of the final model selection.
