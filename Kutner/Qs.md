Great — these are core ideas in linear regression. Let’s tackle them clearly and completely.

## ✅ 1) **Derive OLS (Ordinary Least Squares)**

We’ll derive the OLS estimator for the **simple linear regression** model first:

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \varepsilon_i, \quad i = 1, \dots, n
$$

We observe pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$, and we want to find $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ that **minimize the total squared error**:

$$
\text{Objective: } \min_{\beta_0, \beta_1} \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i)^2
$$

This is a **least squares problem**. Define:

$$
S(\beta_0, \beta_1) = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i)^2
$$

Take partial derivatives and set them to zero (first-order conditions):

### Partial w\.r.t. $\beta_0$:

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_0} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i) = 0
\Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i = n\beta_0 + \beta_1 \sum_{i=1}^n X_i
$$

### Partial w\.r.t. $\beta_1$:

$$
\frac{\partial S}{\partial \beta_1} = -2 \sum_{i=1}^n X_i (Y_i - \beta_0 - \beta_1 X_i) = 0
\Rightarrow \sum_{i=1}^n X_i Y_i = \beta_0 \sum X_i + \beta_1 \sum X_i^2
$$

Solving this **system of equations** gives the **OLS estimators**:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^n (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
$$

$$
\hat{\beta}_0 = \bar{Y} - \hat{\beta}_1 \bar{X}
$$

These formulas minimize the sum of squared errors (SSE).

## ✅ 2) **Estimators: What are they?**

An **estimator** is a formula or rule that gives an estimate of a population parameter using sample data.

* Example: $\hat{\beta}_1$ is the estimator of the slope $\beta_1$
* The **actual value computed from data** is called the **estimate**

So, if you write:

$$
\hat{\beta}_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
$$

— this is an **estimator**. Once you plug in numbers from your sample, you get a numeric **estimate**.

## ✅ 3) **What is a Point Estimator? Why do we need it when OLS "does everything"?**

A **point estimator** gives a **single-number estimate** of a parameter.

* OLS gives us **point estimators** for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$
* A point estimator is part of a broader estimation process

Why is the concept of a **point estimator** still useful?

Because:

1. **Estimation theory** wants to study properties of estimators (bias, variance, consistency, efficiency).
2. A single number (point) isn’t enough — often we also compute **interval estimators** (e.g., confidence intervals).
3. Understanding that $\hat{\beta}_1$ is a **random variable** helps us analyze it across different samples.

So OLS “does everything” in one sense, but formally we need to **analyze** what OLS is doing through the language of point estimators, random variables, and sampling distributions.

### TL;DR Summary

| Concept         | Meaning                                                          |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OLS             | Minimizes squared errors to find best-fit line                   |
| Estimator       | A formula to estimate population parameters from sample data     |
| Point Estimator | Gives a single best guess of a parameter (e.g., $\hat{\beta}_1$) |
| Why needed?     | To study bias, variance, build confidence intervals, etc.        |
