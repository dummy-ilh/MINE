# Chapter 1: What is Regression? Why the Name?

### What is Regression?

**Regression analysis** is a powerful statistical technique used to model the relationship between a **dependent variable** (also called response variable, outcome variable) and one or more **independent variables** (also called predictor variables, explanatory variables, or covariates). The primary goals of regression analysis are:
1.  **Prediction:** To predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
2.  **Inference:** To understand the nature and strength of the relationship between the variables, and to assess the effect of independent variables on the dependent variable.
3.  **Modeling:** To construct a mathematical equation that describes the relationship.

### Why the Name?

The term "regression" was first used by Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century. He observed that while tall parents tended to have tall children, the children's heights, on average, "**regressed**" or "moved back" towards the average height of the population. This phenomenon is known as "regression to the mean." Although modern regression analysis is used for much more than this specific biological phenomenon, the name "regression" stuck. It now broadly refers to statistical methods that model relationships between variables, predicting one from others.

### Statistical Relation Between Two Variables

In statistics, we often deal with two types of relationships:
* **Functional (Deterministic) Relationship:** In this relationship, one variable can be perfectly predicted from another (e.g., $F = 1.8C + 32$). There's no random error.
* **Statistical Relationship:** This is common in real-world data. While variables might tend to move together, the relationship isn't perfect. There's inherent variability, meaning that for a given independent variable, the dependent variable can take on a range of values due to unobserved factors, measurement errors, or inherent randomness. Regression analysis deals with statistical relationships, aiming to capture the systematic part while modeling random variation.

### Basic Concepts

* **Dependent Variable (Y):** The variable we're trying to predict or explain (response variable, outcome variable).
* **Independent Variable(s) (X):** The variable(s) used to predict or explain the dependent variable (predictor variable, explanatory variable, covariate).
* **Regression Function:** The mathematical equation describing the relationship between the **mean of the dependent variable** and the independent variable(s). It represents the systematic part of the relationship.
* **Error Term ($\epsilon$):** Represents the random deviation of an observed value of the dependent variable from its mean (as predicted by the regression function). It accounts for all factors not included in the model, measurement error, and inherent randomness.

### Construction of Regression Models

The process of constructing a regression model typically involves:
1.  **Stating the problem:** Clearly defining the research question and variables.
2.  **Collecting data:** Obtaining relevant data.
3.  **Specifying the model:** Choosing the form of the regression function (e.g., linear) and identifying independent variables.
4.  **Fitting the model:** Estimating the parameters of the regression function from observed data.
5.  **Evaluating the model:** Assessing how well the model fits the data and meets assumptions.
6.  **Using the model:** Making predictions or inferences.

### Regression and Causality

It's crucial to understand that **correlation does not imply causation**. While regression analysis can identify and quantify relationships, it cannot, by itself, prove causality.

* **Association:** Regression shows a strong statistical association.
* **Causation:** To infer causation, one needs to consider:
    * **Temporal precedence:** X must precede Y.
    * **Plausible mechanism:** A logical reason for X to cause Y.
    * **Elimination of confounding variables:** Other variables influencing both X and Y must be controlled for.
    Controlled experiments are often needed to establish causality, whereas observational studies are less conclusive.

### Formal Statement of Model

For **simple linear regression** (one independent variable), the formal model is:

$Y_i = E[Y_i | X_i] + \epsilon_i$

Where:
* $Y_i$ is the $i$-th observed value of the dependent variable.
* $X_i$ is the $i$-th observed value of the independent variable.
* $E[Y_i | X_i]$ is the conditional mean of $Y$ for a given $X_i$, known as the **regression function**.
* $\epsilon_i$ is the random error term for the $i$-th observation.

Assuming a linear relationship for the regression function:

$E[Y_i | X_i] = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i$

Thus, the full simple linear regression model is:

$Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$

Where:
* $\beta_0$ (beta-nought) is the **Y-intercept**. It represents the mean value of $Y$ when $X$ is zero.
* $\beta_1$ (beta-one) is the **slope parameter**. It represents the change in the mean value of $Y$ for a one-unit increase in $X$.
* $\epsilon_i$ are typically assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables following a normal distribution with mean zero and constant variance: $\epsilon_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$.

---

### Important Features of Model

Key features and assumptions of the simple linear regression model ($Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$) often include:

1.  **Linearity:** The relationship between $X$ and the mean of $Y$ ($E[Y|X]$) is linear.
2.  **Normality of Errors:** The error terms $\epsilon_i$ are normally distributed.
3.  **Constant Variance (Homoscedasticity):** The variance of the error terms ($\sigma^2$) is constant across all levels of $X$. $\text{Var}(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$.
4.  **Independence of Errors:** The error terms $\epsilon_i$ are independent of each other.
5.  **X is Fixed or Measured Without Error:** $X$ values are either fixed constants or measured without significant error.

### Meaning of Regression Parameters

Given the model $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$:

* **$\beta_0$ (Intercept):**
    * Represents the mean response $E[Y]$ when $X = 0$.
    * Its interpretation is only meaningful if $X=0$ is within the range of observed $X$ values and makes practical sense.
* **$\beta_1$ (Slope):**
    * Represents the change in the mean response $E[Y]$ for a one-unit increase in $X$.
    * $\beta_1 > 0$ indicates a positive relationship.
    * $\beta_1 < 0$ indicates a negative relationship.
    * $\beta_1 = 0$ indicates no linear relationship.

---

### Estimation of Regression Function

Since the true parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown, we estimate them from sample data $(X_1, Y_1), \dots, (X_n, Y_n)$ using estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$.

The **estimated regression function** (or estimated regression line) is:

$\hat{Y}_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i$

Where:
* $\hat{Y}_i$ is the **predicted value** or **estimated mean response** for a given $X_i$.
* $b_0$ is the estimate of $\beta_0$.
* $b_1$ is the estimate of $\beta_1$.

---

### Method of Least Squares

The **Method of Least Squares** is the most common way to estimate $b_0$ and $b_1$. It finds the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed $Y$ values and the predicted $\hat{Y}$ values.

The difference between an observed $Y_i$ and its predicted $\hat{Y}_i$ is the **residual**, $e_i$:

$e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i = Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i)$

The objective is to minimize the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)** or **Sum of Squared Residuals (SSR)**:

Minimize: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i))^2$

The least squares estimators are:

$b_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2}$

This can also be expressed as:

$b_1 = \frac{s_{XY}}{s_X^2}$

And:

$b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}$

Where $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ are the sample means of $X$ and $Y$.

### Point Estimation of Mean Response

Once the least squares regression line $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X$ is determined, we can estimate the mean response for any given $X_h$:

$\hat{Y}_h = b_0 + b_1 X_h$

This $\hat{Y}_h$ is the best unbiased estimator of $E[Y_h | X_h]$.

---

### Residuals

A **residual** $e_i$ is the difference between the observed $Y_i$ and the predicted $\hat{Y}_i$:

$e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$

Residuals are crucial for:
* **Assessing model fit:** Large residuals indicate poor fit.
* **Checking assumptions:** Patterns in residuals can reveal violations of assumptions.
* **Identifying outliers:** Observations with very large residuals might be outliers.

---

### Properties of Fitted Regression Line

The least squares regression line $\hat{Y}_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i$ has several important properties:

1.  **The sum of the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i = 0$.
2.  **The sum of the squared residuals is a minimum:** This is its defining property.
3.  **The regression line always passes through the point of means ($\bar{X}, \bar{Y}$):**
    * This is evident from the formula for $b_0$: $b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}$.
4.  **The sum of the observed values of $Y$ equals the sum of the fitted values:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{Y}_i$.
5.  **The sum of the cross-products of the $X$ values and the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i e_i = 0$.
6.  **The sum of the cross-products of the fitted values and the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{Y}_i e_i = 0$.




## 1.9 Estimation of Regression Function

Since the true parameters $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ are unknown population values, we must estimate them from sample data. The estimated regression function, also known as the **fitted regression line**, is denoted as:

$\hat{Y}_i = b_0 + b_1 X_i$

Where:
* $\hat{Y}_i$ (read "Y-hat sub i") is the **predicted value** or **estimated mean response** for a given $X_i$. This is the value of $Y$ that the fitted line predicts for $X_i$.
* $b_0$ is the estimate of the population intercept $\beta_0$.
* $b_1$ is the estimate of the population slope $\beta_1$.

Our goal is to find the "best" estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$ from the sample data.

## 1.10 Method of Least Squares

The most widely used method for estimating the parameters $b_0$ and $b_1$ is the **Method of Least Squares**. This method finds the line that minimizes the sum of the squared differences between the observed values of $Y$ and the values predicted by the regression line.

The difference between an observed value $Y_i$ and its corresponding predicted value $\hat{Y}_i$ is called a **residual**, denoted as $e_i$:

$e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i = Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i)$

The **sum of squared errors (SSE)**, also known as the **sum of squared residuals (SSR)**, is the quantity we wish to minimize:

$Q = \sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - (b_0 + b_1 X_i))^2$

To find the values of $b_0$ and $b_1$ that minimize $Q$, we use calculus (take partial derivatives with respect to $b_0$ and $b_1$ and set them to zero). This leads to a system of two linear equations, called the **normal equations**:

1.  $\sum Y_i = n b_0 + b_1 \sum X_i$
2.  $\sum X_i Y_i = b_0 \sum X_i + b_1 \sum X_i^2$

Solving these normal equations for $b_0$ and $b_1$ yields the least squares estimators:

$b_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2}$

This formula can also be expressed as:

$b_1 = \frac{n \sum X_i Y_i - (\sum X_i)(\sum Y_i)}{n \sum X_i^2 - (\sum X_i)^2}$

And the intercept estimator is:

$b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}$

Where $\bar{X}$ and $\bar{Y}$ are the sample means of $X$ and $Y$, respectively. These $b_0$ and $b_1$ values are unique and represent the best-fitting line in the least squares sense.

## 1.11 Point Estimation of Mean Response

Once the least squares estimators $b_0$ and $b_1$ are obtained, the fitted regression line $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X$ can be used to estimate the mean response for any given value of $X$.

If we are interested in the mean response at a specific value of the independent variable, say $X_h$, the point estimate for the mean response $E[Y_h|X_h]$ is:

$\hat{Y}_h = b_0 + b_1 X_h$

This $\hat{Y}_h$ provides the best single estimate of the average value of $Y$ for observations with independent variable value $X_h$, under the assumption that the linear model is correct.

---

## 1.12 Residuals

A **residual** $e_i$ is the vertical distance between an observed data point $Y_i$ and the corresponding point on the fitted regression line $\hat{Y}_i$:

$e_i = Y_i - \hat{Y}_i$

Residuals are essential for:
* **Assessing Model Fit:** Large residuals indicate that the model is not fitting those particular observations well.
* **Checking Model Assumptions:** Patterns in the residuals (e.g., a fanning-out pattern, a curve) can signal violations of the linearity, constant variance, or independence assumptions.
* **Identifying Outliers:** Observations with unusually large residuals (in magnitude) may be outliers or influential data points that warrant further investigation.

## 1.13 Properties of Fitted Regression Line

The least squares regression line, estimated by $b_0$ and $b_1$, has several important mathematical properties:

1.  **The sum of the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} e_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i) = 0$. This is a direct consequence of the first normal equation.
2.  **The sum of the squared residuals is a minimum:** This is the objective criterion the least squares method satisfies. Any other line will result in a larger sum of squared residuals.
3.  **The regression line passes through the point of means ($\bar{X}, \bar{Y}$):**
    * Substituting $\bar{X}$ into the fitted regression equation:
        $\hat{Y}_{\bar{X}} = b_0 + b_1 \bar{X}$
    * Since $b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}$, then $\hat{Y}_{\bar{X}} = (\bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X}) + b_1 \bar{X} = \bar{Y}$.
    * This implies that the "center of gravity" of the data always lies on the fitted line.
4.  **The sum of the observed values of $Y$ equals the sum of the fitted values:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{Y}_i$. This property follows directly from $\sum e_i = 0$.
5.  **The sum of the cross-products of the independent variable values and the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i e_i = 0$.
6.  **The sum of the cross-products of the fitted values and the residuals is zero:** $\sum_{i=1}^{n} \hat{Y}_i e_i = 0$. This implies that the residuals are uncorrelated with the fitted values.
