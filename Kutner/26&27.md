This part of the Table of Contents, "PART SIX: SPECIALIZED STUDY DESIGNS," dives into more advanced and specific experimental designs beyond the basic ANOVA and ANCOVA models.

Here's a detailed breakdown of Chapters 26 and 27:

**Chapter 26: Nested Designs, Subsampling, and Partially Nested Designs**

This chapter focuses on designs where the levels of one factor are "nested" within the levels of another factor, meaning they are unique to each level of the higher-level factor. This contrasts with "crossed" factors, where every level of one factor appears with every level of another.

* **26.1 Distinction between Nested and Crossed Factors:**
    * Clearly defines the difference:
        * **Crossed:** All levels of Factor A occur with all levels of Factor B (e.g., three types of fertilizer (A) applied to two different crop varieties (B) â€“ all 6 combinations are tested).
        * **Nested:** Levels of Factor B are unique to levels of Factor A (e.g., three different production lines (A), and within each line, specific machines (B) are tested. Machine 1 on line 1 is different from machine 1 on line 2). This is crucial for understanding the appropriate ANOVA model.

* **26.2 Two-Factor Nested Designs:**
    * **Development of Model Elements:** Sets up the components of the statistical model.
    * **Nested Design Model:** Presents the linear model for a two-factor nested design.
    * **Random Factor Effects:** Often, the nested factor is considered a random effect (e.g., the machines are a random sample of machines within each line).

* **26.3 Analysis of Variance for Two-Factor Nested Designs:**
    * **Fitting of Model:** How to estimate the parameters of the nested ANOVA model.
    * **Sums of Squares:** Explains how the total variation is partitioned (e.g., variability due to the main factor, variability due to the nested factor *within* the main factor, and error).
    * **Degrees of Freedom:** Calculation of degrees of freedom for each source of variation.
    * **Tests for Factor Effects:** How to perform F-tests for the main and nested factors. Crucially, the denominator for the F-test of the main factor is often the mean square of the nested factor, not the error mean square, especially if the nested factor is random.
    * **Random Factor Effects:** Reinforces the implications for testing when the nested factor is random.
    * **Evaluation of Appropriateness of Nested Design Model:** Discusses checking assumptions.

* **26.4 Analysis of Factor Effects in Two-Factor Nested Designs:**
    * **Estimation of Factor Level Means ($\mu_{i.}$):** Estimating the mean for each level of the primary factor.
    * **Estimation of Treatment Means ($\mu_{ij}$):** Estimating the mean for each specific nested combination.
    * **Estimation of Overall Mean ($\mu$...):** Estimating the grand mean.
    * **Estimation of Variance Components:** For random nested factors, estimating how much variance is attributed to the nesting factor.

* **26.5 Unbalanced Nested Two-Factor Designs:** Addresses the challenges when the number of observations in nested groups is unequal.

* **26.6 Subsampling in Single-Factor Study with Completely Randomized Design:**
    * **Model:** Introduces a scenario where individual units are subsampled within experimental units (e.g., taking multiple measurements from one plant, where the plant is the experimental unit).
    * **Analysis of Variance and Tests of Effects:** How ANOVA is adjusted for subsampling, and how to test for effects.
    * **Estimation of Treatment Effects:** Estimating treatment means.
    * **Estimation of Variances:** Estimating different variance components (e.g., between-unit variance, within-unit/subsampling variance).

* **26.7 Pure Subsampling in Three Stages:** Extends the subsampling concept to three levels of nesting (e.g., large area $\rightarrow$ sub-areas $\rightarrow$ individual samples).
    * **Model:** The statistical model for three-stage subsampling.
    * **Analysis of Variance:** How sums of squares and tests are performed.
    * **Estimation of $\mu$..:** Estimating the overall mean.

* **26.8 Three-Factor Partially Nested Designs:** Combines crossed and nested factors in more complex designs.
    * **Development of Model:** Setting up the model for such a design.
    * **Analysis of Variance:** Performing ANOVA for partially nested designs.

* **Cited Reference, Problems, Exercises, Projects:** Standard textbook supplementary materials.

**Chapter 27: Repeated Measures and Related Designs**

This chapter deals with designs where the same experimental units (e.g., subjects, patients, plots) are measured multiple times under different conditions or over time. This introduces correlation among the observations from the same unit, which needs to be accounted for in the analysis.

* **27.1 Elements of Repeated Measures Designs:**
    * **Description of Designs:** Explains what repeated measures designs are.
    * **Advantages and Disadvantages:** Benefits (e.g., increased power, reduced error variability because each subject serves as their own control) and drawbacks (e.g., carryover effects, order effects, sphericity assumption).
    * **How to Randomize:** Discusses randomization strategies (e.g., counterbalancing treatment orders).

* **27.2 Single-Factor Experiments with Repeated Measures on All Treatments:** The simplest repeated measures design, where one factor is manipulated, and all subjects receive all levels of that factor.
    * **Model:** The statistical model for this design, often incorporating a subject effect.
    * **Analysis of Variance and Tests:** How to perform ANOVA and F-tests. The partitioning of variance is different from between-subjects designs.
    * **Evaluation of Appropriateness of Repeated Measures Model:** Crucially, addresses the **sphericity assumption** (or compound symmetry), which is a key assumption for valid F-tests in many repeated measures ANOVAs. Violations often require adjustments (e.g., Greenhouse-Geisser, Huynh-Feldt corrections).
    * **Analysis of Treatment Effects:** Interpreting the results.
    * **Ranked Data:** Using non-parametric methods if assumptions are violated.
    * **Multiple Pairwise Testing Procedure:** Post-hoc tests for repeated measures.

* **27.3 Two-Factor Experiments with Repeated Measures on One Factor:** A mixed design where one factor is repeated measures, and another is a between-subjects factor.
    * **Description of Design:** Explains the setup.
    * **Model:** The statistical model.
    * **Analysis of Variance and Tests:** ANOVA calculations and F-tests for main effects and interaction.
    * **Evaluation of Appropriateness of Repeated Measures Model:** Again, sphericity is a major concern.
    * **Analysis of Factor Effects: Without Interaction:** Interpreting main effects if interaction is not significant.
    * **Analysis of Factor Effects: With Interaction:** Interpreting the interaction and simple main effects.
    * **Blocking of Subjects in Repeated Measures Designs:** How subjects themselves act as blocks.

* **27.4 Two-Factor Experiments with Repeated Measures on Both Factors:** A more complex design where both factors are within-subjects.
    * **Model:** The statistical model.
    * **Analysis of Variance and Tests:** ANOVA calculations.
    * **Evaluation of Appropriateness of Repeated Measures Model:** Sphericity assumption for both within-subject factors.
    * **Analysis of Factor Effects:** Interpretation.

* **27.5 Regression Approach to Repeated Measures Designs:** Explains how repeated measures ANOVA can be analyzed using a general linear model framework (e.g., mixed models in regression software). This is often preferred in practice due to its flexibility with missing data and varying covariance structures.

* **27.6 Split-Plot Designs:** This is a specific type of mixed-model design that combines features of randomized complete blocks and repeated measures. It's common in agriculture or industrial experiments where some factors are applied to large "whole plots" and others to smaller "subplots" within those plots.

This entire "Specialized Study Designs" part of the book moves into topics that are essential for researchers designing complex experiments, providing tools to handle common real-world scenarios in data collection and analysis.
