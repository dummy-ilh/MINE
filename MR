Title: Technical Report: Fine-Tuning Model X (DistilBERT) to Model Y for Policy Classification

1. Introduction:
   Model X, a DistilBERT model trained from scratch, serves as the foundation for Model Y, which is fine-tuned specifically for policy classification tasks. This report outlines the technical process and rationale behind fine-tuning Model X to create Model Y.

2. Background:
   DistilBERT is a distilled version of the BERT model, renowned for its efficiency and effectiveness in natural language processing tasks. Fine-tuning involves adjusting the pre-trained parameters of a model on a task-specific dataset to enhance its performance for that particular task.

3. Fine-Tuning Process:
   a. Dataset Preparation:
      - A labeled dataset comprising policy documents and their corresponding categories is curated for fine-tuning Model X.
      - The dataset undergoes preprocessing, including tokenization and formatting, to prepare it for input into the model.

   b. Model Initialization:
      - Model X, pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, serves as the starting point for fine-tuning.
      - The parameters of Model X are initialized with the weights obtained during the training phase.

   c. Fine-Tuning Objective:
      - The objective of fine-tuning is to optimize Model X's performance for policy classification by updating its parameters on the task-specific dataset.
      - The model is trained using techniques such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimization to minimize the loss function, typically cross-entropy loss.

   d. Training Procedure:
      - The fine-tuning process involves feeding batches of policy documents and their corresponding labels into Model X and updating its parameters iteratively.
      - The learning rate is adjusted to ensure that the model learns task-specific features without overfitting to the training data.
      - The training continues over multiple epochs until the model converges to a satisfactory performance level.

   e. Evaluation and Validation:
      - Throughout the fine-tuning process, Model Y's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
      - The model's performance is validated on a separate validation dataset to assess its generalization ability.

4. Rationale for Fine-Tuning:
   - Policy classification tasks require models to capture nuanced language patterns specific to legal documents.
   - Fine-tuning Model X on a task-specific dataset allows Model Y to learn relevant features and improve its performance for policy classification.
   - By leveraging the pre-trained knowledge encoded in Model X and adapting it to the policy classification domain, Model Y achieves better results than training from scratch.

5. Conclusion:
   Fine-tuning Model X to create Model Y for policy classification involves adjusting the pre-trained parameters of Model X on a task-specific dataset. This process enhances Model Y's performance by leveraging the pre-trained knowledge and adapting it to the policy classification domain. Overall, fine-tuning enables the development of a specialized model tailored to the specific requirements of policy classification tasks.
