# 📏 Distance Metrics in Machine Learning

---

## 📘 What Is a Distance Metric?

A **distance metric** quantifies how far two points are in a feature space.
Used in:

* K-Means
* K-NN
* DBSCAN
* Hierarchical clustering
* Recommender systems (via similarity)

---

## ✅ 1. **Euclidean Distance** (L2 Norm)

### Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sqrt{ \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - y_i)^2 }
$$

### 🔍 Intuition:

Straight-line ("as-the-crow-flies") distance in space.

### ✅ Use When:

* Data is continuous & normalized
* K-Means (default)
* PCA visualizations

---

## ✅ 2. **Manhattan Distance** (L1 Norm)

### Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|
$$

### 🔍 Intuition:

City block distance — like navigating on a grid.

### ✅ Use When:

* Features are sparse (e.g., text, count data)
* More robust to outliers than Euclidean

---

## ✅ 3. **Minkowski Distance** (Generalized form)

### Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i - y_i|^p \right)^{1/p}
$$

* If $p = 1$: Manhattan
* If $p = 2$: Euclidean
* If $p \to \infty$: Chebyshev

### ✅ Use When:

* Want to tune how sensitive distance is to large differences

---

## ✅ 4. **Cosine Similarity** (Angle, not length)

### Formula:

$$
\cos(\theta) = \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \cdot \|y\|}
$$

* **Cosine Distance** = $1 - \cos(\theta)$

### 🔍 Intuition:

How similar directions are, **regardless of magnitude**

### ✅ Use When:

* Text embeddings (TF-IDF, BERT)
* High-dimensional sparse vectors
* Recommender systems

---

## ✅ 5. **Hamming Distance**

### Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^n [x_i \ne y_i]
$$

### ✅ Use When:

* Binary/categorical variables
* DNA sequences, user click behavior

---

## ✅ 6. **Jaccard Distance**

$$
\text{Jaccard}(A, B) = 1 - \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$

### ✅ Use When:

* Sets: tags, attributes, shopping baskets
* Binary features

---

## ✅ 7. **Mahalanobis Distance**

$$
d(x, y) = \sqrt{ (x - y)^T S^{-1} (x - y) }
$$

Where $S$ is the covariance matrix.

### ✅ Use When:

* Variables are **correlated**
* You want to **normalize for variance** and **covariance**
* Anomaly detection

# 🔥 Top FAANG Interview Questions on Distance Metrics

---

### ❓ Q1. Why does K-Means use Euclidean distance by default?

✅ A: Because K-Means minimizes the **within-cluster sum of squares**, which is Euclidean-based. The centroid is defined as the **mean**, which makes sense only with L2 distance.

---

### ❓ Q2. When would you prefer Cosine similarity over Euclidean?

✅ A: When magnitude doesn’t matter but **direction does** — e.g., in **text embeddings**, TF-IDF, recommender systems, or high-dimensional sparse data.

---

### ❓ Q3. What happens if you use Cosine distance in K-Means?

✅ A: K-Means is not compatible with Cosine unless you **normalize all vectors** and re-define centroid logic. Use **Spherical K-Means** instead.

---

### ❓ Q4. How do distance metrics affect K-NN classifier?

✅ A: Choice of distance directly impacts nearest neighbor selection.

* Euclidean: sensitive to scale
* Manhattan: more robust
* Cosine: better for sparse vectors
  You must **scale/normalize** if using L2.

---

### ❓ Q5. What is Mahalanobis distance and how is it different from Euclidean?

✅ A: Mahalanobis accounts for **feature correlation** using the **covariance matrix**. Unlike Euclidean, it “whitens” the space — all directions treated equally.

---

### ❓ Q6. Why should features be normalized when using distance-based algorithms?

✅ A: Because units vary — e.g., \[income in lakhs, age in years] — distance becomes biased toward high-magnitude features. Normalization ensures **fair comparison**.

---

### ❓ Q7. How do you cluster binary data?

✅ A:

* Use **K-Modes** or **KModes + Hamming distance**
* Use **Jaccard similarity**
* Avoid Euclidean

---

### ❓ Q8. Why is Manhattan distance more robust to outliers?

✅ A: Because it sums **absolute differences**, not squared ones — large deviations don’t explode as in Euclidean.

---

### ❓ Q9. Can you use different distances for each feature?

✅ A: Yes — called **Gower distance**.

* It handles **mixed data types** (categorical + numeric)
* Uses **feature-wise** distance definitions

---

### ❓ Q10. In anomaly detection, why use Mahalanobis distance?

✅ A: It flags points that are far from the **multivariate mean**, accounting for correlation → more sensitive to **joint outliers**.

---

## ✅ Bonus: Python Code to Compare Distance Metrics

```python
from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 0]])

pairwise_distances(X, metric='euclidean')
pairwise_distances(X, metric='manhattan')
pairwise_distances(X, metric='cosine')
```

# 🧠 Understanding: Why Certain Distance Metrics Work Better in Certain Cases

---

## 🔵 1. **Euclidean Distance** — L2 Norm

### 🔍 Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sqrt{\sum_i (x_i - y_i)^2}
$$

### ✅ Best For:

* **Continuous**, **dense**, and **normalized** data
* Assumes features have the **same scale**
* When **shape & magnitude** matter

### ❌ Not Good When:

* Features are in **different units** (e.g., age vs salary)
* **Outliers** exist (because squared terms amplify them)

### 🧠 Why?

* Because it’s based on the **Pythagorean Theorem**, and assumes all dimensions contribute equally.
* Squared terms **exaggerate differences**, so it’s **sensitive to outliers**.

---

## 🟠 2. **Manhattan Distance** — L1 Norm

### 🔍 Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sum_i |x_i - y_i|
$$

### ✅ Best For:

* Sparse data (lots of 0s)
* Data with **outliers**
* High-dimensional, grid-like data

### ❌ Not Ideal When:

* You care about exact geometric distance (diagonal shortcuts)

### 🧠 Why?

* L1 is **less sensitive to large deviations** because it uses **absolute difference**.
* Common in **LASSO regression**, **text classification**, and **image recognition** where values can spike.

---

## 🟢 3. **Cosine Distance** — Direction Only

### 🔍 Formula:

$$
1 - \cos(\theta) = 1 - \frac{x \cdot y}{\|x\| \cdot \|y\|}
$$

### ✅ Best For:

* **Text data**, **embeddings**, **high-dimensional sparse** vectors
* Comparing **similarity in direction**, not magnitude

### ❌ Not Ideal When:

* Magnitude matters (e.g., number of purchases, distance travelled)

### 🧠 Why?

* In NLP, two documents may use **similar words**, but one might be longer. Cosine says: *they're still similar in theme*.
* For example: TF-IDF vectors are long and sparse — cosine only cares about **what words** you use, not **how many**.

---

## 🟡 4. **Jaccard Distance** — Set Overlap

### 🔍 Formula:

$$
1 - \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|}
$$

### ✅ Best For:

* **Sets**: Tags, categories, attributes
* Recommender systems, NLP keyword overlap

### ❌ Not Good For:

* Real-valued data

### 🧠 Why?

* Captures how much two sets **share in common**, not how far apart they are numerically.
* Ex: 2 users who both liked "Sci-Fi", "Action" movies → high similarity.

---

## 🔴 5. **Hamming Distance** — Bit Mismatch

### ✅ Best For:

* Binary strings
* DNA sequences
* Yes/No-type features

### 🧠 Why?

* Simply counts mismatches.
* Ideal when **every position is equally important** (like matching login tokens or gene strings).

---

## 🟣 6. **Mahalanobis Distance** — Correlation-aware

### 🔍 Formula:

$$
d(x, y) = \sqrt{(x - y)^T S^{-1} (x - y)}
$$

Where $S$ is the **covariance matrix**

### ✅ Best For:

* Multivariate Gaussian data
* Features with **correlation**
* **Anomaly detection**

### ❌ Not Ideal For:

* High-dimension, small sample (S becomes unstable)
* When no feature correlation exists

### 🧠 Why?

* Think of it like **standardizing distance** across all features, accounting for how they co-vary.
* If height and weight are correlated, Mahalanobis **doesn't double count them**, unlike Euclidean.

# 🎯 Summary Table — Why Certain Metrics Work Better

| Metric          | Intuition / Why It Works                                                                  | Ideal For                 |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Euclidean**   | Measures actual "straight line" distance — works best when all features are on same scale | Balanced, continuous data |
| **Manhattan**   | Each feature contributes independently; outliers don’t explode it                         | Sparse, robust data       |
| **Cosine**      | Ignores magnitude; focuses on angle/direction                                             | NLP, document similarity  |
| **Jaccard**     | Works on presence/absence — overlap of sets                                               | Binary feature similarity |
| **Hamming**     | Pure mismatch count — exact position match needed                                         | DNA, keys, binary configs |
| **Mahalanobis** | Removes correlation, gives ellipse-shaped clusters                                        | Multivariate normal data  |

---

# 🧪 Example: Cosine vs Euclidean

\| Document A: `TF-IDF = [3, 0, 2, 0]` | Document B: `TF-IDF = [6, 0, 4, 0]` |

* **Euclidean distance** = √\[(6–3)² + (4–2)²] = √(9 + 4) = √13
* **Cosine similarity** = angle between vectors → **= 1 (identical direction)**

📌 Cosine says "They're the same!", Euclidean says "They're far!"

---

## ✅ Interview Question: “Why not always use Euclidean distance?”

**Answer:**

> Because Euclidean assumes:
>
> * Features are uncorrelated
> * On the same scale
> * Magnitude matters

**But in NLP, recommender systems, or anomaly detection — those assumptions break. So we use metrics like Cosine, Jaccard, or Mahalanobis.**

---

## 🔚 Final Thought

> **Always ask:**
> *"Do direction, scale, or set overlap matter more here?"*
