# 🔁 ISLR Chapter 5: Resampling Methods — Master Notes

---

## 🎯 Why Resampling?

- In most real-world scenarios, we have **limited data**, and we want to:
  - Estimate model performance
  - Choose tuning parameters (like `k` in k-NN)
  - Reduce **overfitting**
  - Avoid misleading **training error** (which underestimates test error)

---

## 🔁 1. Cross-Validation (CV)

---

### 📘 Concept

- Resample your data to simulate performance on **unseen test data**
- Core idea: partition data, train on part, test on the rest
- Avoids need for **a separate validation set**, which wastes data

---

### 🧪 a. **Validation Set Approach**

- Split data into **training** and **validation**
- Fit model on training, evaluate on validation

#### ✅ Pros:
- Simple, fast

#### ❌ Cons:
- High variance (depends on split)
- Wastes data (only partial training)

---

### 🧪 b. **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV)**

- For `n` observations:
  - Train on `n−1`, test on the left-out point
  - Repeat `n` times

\[
\text{LOOCV Error} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \text{MSE}_i
\]

#### ✅ Pros:
- Low bias (almost full training set each time)
- Deterministic (no randomness)

#### ❌ Cons:
- Very high variance (models are highly correlated)
- Very slow for complex models

---

### 🧪 c. **k-Fold Cross-Validation**

- Split data into `k` **equal parts**
- For each fold:
  - Train on `k−1` folds
  - Test on the remaining fold
- Average the test error across all `k` folds

#### ✅ Pros:
- Bias-variance trade-off:
  - Small `k` → higher bias, lower variance
  - Large `k` → lower bias, higher variance
- Faster than LOOCV

#### ❌ Cons:
- Depends on `k`
- Still computationally expensive

#### Common Choices:
- **k = 5 or 10** typically used

---

### 🔁 d. **Repeated k-Fold CV**

- Repeat `k`-fold CV multiple times with different splits
- Reduces variance even more

---

## 🎯 CV: Bias-Variance Summary

| Method     | Bias     | Variance  | Speed      |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| Validation | High     | High      | Fast       |
| LOOCV      | Low      | High      | Very slow  |
| k-Fold     | Medium   | Medium    | Moderate   |

---

## 🎲 2. The Bootstrap

---

### 📘 Concept

- Resample **with replacement** from the dataset
- Each bootstrap sample: same size as original data
- Estimate **sampling distribution** of any statistic

---

### 🛠 How It Works

To estimate standard error of statistic \( \hat{\theta} \):
1. Sample dataset `B` times (e.g. 1000 bootstrap samples)
2. Compute \( \hat{\theta}^*_b \) for each resample `b`
3. Estimate standard error:

\[
\text{SE}_{\text{bootstrap}} = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{B - 1} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \left( \hat{\theta}^*_b - \bar{\hat{\theta}}^* \right)^2 }
\]

---

### 🔄 Example: Estimate standard error of the median

```python
import numpy as np

data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
medians = [np.median(np.random.choice(data, size=5, replace=True)) for _ in range(1000)]
np.std(medians)  # Bootstrap estimate of standard error of median
````

---

### 🔍 Properties

* Each bootstrap sample includes \~63% of original data (on average)
* Because:

$$
\lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 - \frac{1}{n}\right)^n \approx 0.368
$$

## 📊 When to Use What?

| Method         | Use Case                                      | Good For                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Validation Set | Quick sanity check                            | Small models, prototyping          |
| LOOCV          | Low-bias error estimation                     | Small datasets, simple models      |
| k-Fold CV      | General model tuning / selection              | Most practical ML tasks            |
| Bootstrap      | Estimating standard error/confidence interval | Any statistic (mean, median, coef) |

## ⚠️ Pitfalls and Interview Traps

* **Q**: Why is training error not a good measure of performance?
  **A**: It's overly optimistic → it doesn't simulate generalization.

* **Q**: Is LOOCV always better than validation set?
  **A**: No — LOOCV can have **high variance** and be **slow**.

* **Q**: When does bootstrap fail?
  **A**: For non-smooth statistics (like mode), or time-series (not i.i.d.)

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Interview-Grade Summary Points

* CV is about estimating **test error**; Bootstrap is about **uncertainty of a statistic**
* LOOCV ≠ unbiased — it has **low bias** but **high variance**
* Bootstrap works because the resamples mimic the population via empirical distribution
* Don't use vanilla CV in **time series** — use **rolling-window or block CV**

---

## ✅ What You Should Remember

* Use **k-Fold CV** for model selection
* Use **bootstrap** for estimating standard errors or confidence intervals
* Both methods allow you to get **more from less data**
* Real-world ML pipelines use **nested CV** for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation

## 🔍 Comparison Table: Which to Use When?

| Task / Situation                               | Best Resampling Method         | Why?                                                 |

## 🧠 Interview Questions & Answers

---

### ❓ Q1: Why not always use LOOCV if it uses almost all data for training?

**A:**  
Because LOOCV has:
- **Low bias**, but
- **High variance** — each model is very similar, but predictions on single points are noisy.
- Also **computationally expensive** for large datasets.

---

### ❓ Q2: You only have 100 data points. Which method would you choose and why?

**A:**  
- Use **LOOCV** or **k-Fold CV (k=10)**.
- If computation is manageable, **LOOCV** makes use of almost the entire dataset for training.
- If faster evaluation is needed, go with **10-fold CV**.

---

### ❓ Q3: What’s the key conceptual difference between cross-validation and the bootstrap?

**A:**

| Cross-Validation | Bootstrap |
|------------------|-----------|
| Evaluates **test error** / generalization | Estimates **uncertainty** (SE, CI) |
| Data split into **train/test folds** | **Sampled with replacement** |
| Goal: Choose model | Goal: Quantify variability |

---

### ❓ Q4: When can the bootstrap give misleading results?

**A:**
- For **non-smooth statistics** like the **mode**
- When data is **time-dependent** or **not i.i.d.**
- When sampling breaks important **structure or dependencies**

---

### ❓ Q5: Why is 10-fold CV often preferred over LOOCV?

**A:**  
- 10-fold CV has **lower variance** than LOOCV.
- Offers a **good balance** between bias and variance.
- **Less computational cost** while still giving accurate test error estimates.

---

### ❓ Q6: How would you estimate model accuracy and also uncertainty in the metric?

**A:**
- Use **k-fold CV** to estimate accuracy (e.g., mean CV error).
- Use **bootstrap** to estimate the **standard deviation** or **confidence interval** of the metric.

---

### ❓ Q7: What if test error varies a lot between folds?

**A:**
- Use **repeated k-fold CV** or **stratified CV** if classes are imbalanced.
- High variation might indicate the model is **unstable** or **data is noisy**.
- Consider **simplifying the model** or **using regularization**.
