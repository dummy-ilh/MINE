## 📊 Chapter 1: Introduction to Regression Analysis

[cite_start]Linear models play a central part in modern statistical methods[cite: 2]. [cite_start]These models can approximate a large amount of metric data structures in their entire range of definition or at least piecewise[cite: 3].

### Linear Models and Regression Analysis

[cite_start]The outcome of any process is denoted by a random variable $y$, called the **dependent (or study) variable**[cite: 5]. [cite_start]This variable depends on $k$ **independent (or explanatory) variables**, denoted by $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{k}$[cite: 5].

The behavior of $y$ can be explained by a relationship given by:
[cite_start]$$y=f(X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k},\beta_{1},\beta_{2},\dots,\beta_{k})+\epsilon [cite: 6]$$

* [cite_start]$f$ is some well-defined function[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]$\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots, \beta_{k}$ are the **parameters** which characterize the role and contribution of $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{k}$, respectively[cite: 7].
* [cite_start]The term $\epsilon$ reflects the **stochastic nature** of the relationship, indicating that such a relationship is not exact in nature[cite: 8].
    * [cite_start]When $\epsilon=0$, the relationship is called the **mathematical model**[cite: 9].
    * [cite_start]Otherwise, it is called the **statistical model**[cite: 9].

#### Defining Linear and Nonlinear Models

[cite_start]A model or relationship is termed as **linear** if it is **linear in parameters** and **nonlinear** if it is not linear in parameters[cite: 11].

* [cite_start]**Linear Model Condition:** A model is linear if all the partial derivatives of $y$ with respect to each of the parameters $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots, \beta_{k}$ are **independent of the parameters**[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]**Nonlinear Model Condition:** A model is nonlinear if any of the partial derivatives of $y$ with respect to any of $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots, \beta_{k}$ is **not independent of the parameters**[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]**Note:** The linearity or non-linearity of the model is **not described by the linearity or nonlinearity of explanatory variables** in the model[cite: 14].

| Example Model | Type | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]$y=\beta_{1}X_{1}^{2}+\beta_{2}\sqrt{X_{2}}+\beta_{3}\log X_{3}+\epsilon$ [cite: 16] | **Linear** | [cite_start]$\partial y/\partial\beta_{i}$, ($i=1,2,3$), are independent of the parameters $\beta_{i}$[cite: 17]. |
| [cite_start]$y=\beta_{1}^{2}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\beta_{3}\log X+\epsilon$ [cite: 20] | **Nonlinear** | [cite_start]$\partial y/\partial\beta_{1}=2\beta_{1}X_{1}$ depends on $\beta_{1}$[cite: 21]. |

#### The Role of Regression Analysis

In general, the function $f$ for a linear model is often chosen as:
[cite_start]$$f(X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{k},\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\dots,\beta_{k})=\beta_{1}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\dots+\beta_{k}X_{k} [cite: 27]$$

[cite_start]Since $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{k}$ (explanatory variables) and $y$ (outcome) are known, the knowledge of the model depends on the knowledge of the parameters $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots, \beta_{k}$[cite: 28, 29].

**Linear statistical modeling** consists of developing approaches and tools to determine $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}, \dots, \beta_{k}$ in the linear model:
[cite_start]$$y=\beta_{1}X_{1}+\beta_{2}X_{2}+\dots+\beta_{k}X_{k}+\epsilon [cite: 31]$$
[cite_start]given the observations on $y$ and $X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{k}$[cite: 32].

[cite_start]**Regression analysis** is a tool/technique to determine the values of these parameters using the data[cite: 36, 49].

* [cite_start]The literal meaning of regression is **"to move in the backward direction"**[cite: 36].
* [cite_start]This refers to the process where the collected data (generated by a pre-existing, unknown model) is used to determine the parameters of that model[cite: 42, 43, 56].

### Steps in Regression Analysis

[cite_start]Regression analysis is a structured process including the following steps[cite: 60]:

1.  [cite_start]**Statement of the problem under consideration** [cite: 61][cite_start]: Specify the objectives to be addressed[cite: 73].
2.  [cite_start]**Choice of relevant variables** [cite: 62][cite_start]: Select the appropriate study and explanatory variables based on the problem formulation[cite: 81].
3.  [cite_start]**Collection of data on relevant variables** [cite: 63][cite_start]: Measure the chosen variables, deciding whether to use **quantitative variables** (e.g., age in years) or **qualitative variables** (e.g., age coded as 1 if < 18, 0 if > 18)[cite: 85, 88, 90].
    * [cite_start]Different techniques are used based on variable types (e.g., **Logistic regression** for binary study variable, **Analysis of Variance** if all explanatory variables are qualitative)[cite: 93, 94].
4.  [cite_start]**Specification of model** [cite: 64][cite_start]: Determine the tentative form of the function $f$, which will depend on some unknown parameters ($\beta_i$'s)[cite: 106, 108].
    * [cite_start]Models with one explanatory variable are **simple regression models**[cite: 120].
    * [cite_start]Models with more than one explanatory variable are **multiple regression models**[cite: 121].
5.  [cite_start]**Choice of method for fitting the data** [cite: 65][cite_start]: Select a method to estimate the parameters[cite: 127].
    * [cite_start]The most common is the **least-squares method**[cite: 129]. [cite_start]Other methods include maximum likelihood, ridge method, etc.[cite: 131].
6.  [cite_start]**Fitting of model** [cite: 66][cite_start]: Substitute the estimates of the parameters ($\hat{\beta}_{1},\hat{\beta}_{2},\dots,\hat{\beta}_{k}$) into the equation to get a usable, fitted model[cite: 133, 134, 137].
    * [cite_start]The fitted equation is used for **prediction**[cite: 140].
    * [cite_start]Prediction for future values of explanatory variables is called **forecasting**[cite: 143].
7.  [cite_start]**Model validation and criticism** [cite: 67][cite_start]: Assess the validity of the assumptions, as the quality of statistical inferences heavily depends on them being satisfied[cite: 149, 151].
    * [cite_start]This is an **iterative process** where outputs (estimation of parameters, tests of hypothesis) are used to diagnose, validate, criticize, and modify the inputs (theories, model, data, assumptions)[cite: 159, 160].
    * [cite_start] [cite: 159, 160]
8.  [cite_start]**Using the chosen model(s) for the solution of the posed problem** [cite: 68][cite_start]: The final regression equation can be used for purposes like policy formulation or forecasting[cite: 177].

| Type of Regression | Conditions |
| :--- | :--- |
| [cite_start]**Univariate** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]Only one quantitative response variable[cite: 122, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Multivariate** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]Two or more quantitative response variables[cite: 123, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Simple** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]Only one explanatory variable[cite: 120, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Multiple** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]Two or more explanatory variables[cite: 121, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Linear** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]All parameters enter the equation linearly, possibly after transformation of the data[cite: 111, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Nonlinear** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]The relationship is nonlinear, or some parameters appear nonlinearly, and no transformation is possible to make them appear linearly[cite: 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Analysis of Variance** (ANOVA) [cite: 147] | [cite_start]All explanatory variables are qualitative variables[cite: 94, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Analysis of Covariance** (ANCOVA) [cite: 147] | [cite_start]Some explanatory variables are quantitative and others are qualitative variables[cite: 95, 147]. |
| [cite_start]**Logistic** [cite: 147] | [cite_start]The response variable is qualitative (e.g., binary)[cite: 93, 147]. |
