# Chapter 5: Matrix Approach to Simple Linear Regression Analysis

Matrix algebra is widely used in mathematical and statistical analysis and becomes a
practical necessity in **multiple regression analysis**, where large systems of equations and
large data sets must be represented compactly and manipulated efficiently. Although
matrix algebra is not strictly required for **simple linear regression**, applying matrix
methods in this setting provides a natural and important transition to multiple regression,
which is developed in later chapters. Readers already familiar with matrix algebra may
focus mainly on the regression-related sections.

## 5.1 Matrices

### Definition of a Matrix

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of elements arranged in **rows** and **columns**. For
example:

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
16000 & 23 \\
33000 & 35 \\
21000 & 35
\end{bmatrix}
$$

In this example:
- each **row** corresponds to a person,
- each **column** corresponds to a characteristic (income, age),
- the element in row 1, column 1 represents the income of the first person.

The **dimension** of a matrix is written as  
\[
\text{number of rows} \times \text{number of columns}
\]
so the above matrix has dimension $3 \times 2$.

### General Notation

A matrix can be written symbolically as:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1c} \\
a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2c} \\
\vdots & \vdots &        & \vdots \\
a_{r1} & a_{r2} & \cdots & a_{rc}
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{5.1}
$$

or compactly as:

$$
A = [a_{ij}], \quad i = 1,\ldots,r; \; j = 1,\ldots,c
$$

The first subscript identifies the **row**, and the second identifies the **column**.

> A matrix should not be thought of as a number. Only a $1 \times 1$ matrix can be treated
> interchangeably as a single number.

### Square Matrices and Vectors

- A **square matrix** has the same number of rows and columns.
- A **column vector** is a matrix with one column.
- A **row vector** is a matrix with one row.

Examples:

$$
\text{Column vector: } 
\begin{bmatrix}
a \\
b \\
c
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (3 \times 1)
$$

$$
\text{Row vector: } 
\begin{bmatrix}
15 & 25 & 50
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (1 \times 3)
$$

For vectors, a single subscript is sufficient to identify elements.

### Transpose of a Matrix

The **transpose** of a matrix $A$, denoted by $A'$, is obtained by interchanging rows and
columns.

If:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 5 \\
7 & 10 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (3 \times 2)
$$

then:

$$
A' =
\begin{bmatrix}
2 & 7 & 3 \\
5 & 10 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (2 \times 3)
$$

In general:

$$
A = [a_{ij}], \quad i = 1,\ldots,r; \; j = 1,\ldots,c
$$

$$
A' = [a_{ji}], \quad j = 1,\ldots,c; \; i = 1,\ldots,r
\tag{5.3}
$$

Thus, the element in the $i$th row and $j$th column of $A$ appears in the $j$th row and
$i$th column of $A'$.

### Equality of Matrices

Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are **equal** if:
1. they have the same dimensions, and
2. all corresponding elements are equal.

For example, if:

$$
A =
\begin{bmatrix}
a_1 \\
a_2 \\
a_3
\end{bmatrix},
\quad
B =
\begin{bmatrix}
4 \\
7 \\
3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

then $A = B$ implies:

$$
a_1 = 4, \quad a_2 = 7, \quad a_3 = 3
$$

## Matrices in Regression Analysis

### Response Vector

In regression analysis, the **response vector** $Y$ contains the $n$ observed values of the
response variable:

$$
Y =
\begin{bmatrix}
Y_1 \\
Y_2 \\
\vdots \\
Y_n
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (n \times 1)
\tag{5.4}
$$

Its transpose is the row vector:

$$
Y' = [\, Y_1 \; Y_2 \; \cdots \; Y_n \,]
\tag{5.5}
$$

### Design Matrix for Simple Linear Regression

For simple linear regression, the **design matrix** $X$ is defined as:

$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & X_1 \\
1 & X_2 \\
\vdots & \vdots \\
1 & X_n
\end{bmatrix}
\quad (n \times 2)
\tag{5.6}
$$

The first column of ones corresponds to the intercept term, and the second column contains
the observed predictor values.

The transpose of $X$ is:

$$
X' =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
X_1 & X_2 & \cdots & X_n
\end{bmatrix}
\tag{5.7}
$$

The matrix $X$ is called the **design matrix** because it encodes the structure of the
regression model and the observed predictor values.
