## 7.1 Extra Sums of Squares

### Basic Ideas 
The concept of "extra sum of squares" is fundamental for understanding the marginal or unique contribution of predictor variables in a multiple regression model.
An **extra sum of squares** represents the **reduction in the error sum of squares (SSE)**, or equivalently, the **increase in the regression sum of squares (SSR)**, when one or more predictor variables are added to a regression model that already contains other predictor variables.
It quantifies the additional variability in $Y$ explained by the new predictor(s), *given* the predictors already present in the model. This makes it a powerful tool for assessing the incremental explanatory power.

## Body Fat Regression Example

## Body Fat Regression Example

Table 7.1 contains data for a study relating amount of body fat $Y$ to predictor variables triceps skinfold thickness $X_1$, thigh circumference $X_2$, and midarm circumference $X_3$, based on 20 healthy females aged 25-34. Body fat measurement required expensive water immersion, making regression prediction from easy-to-obtain predictors valuable.

Table 7.2 shows regression results for four models:
- $Y$ on $X_1$ only: $\text{SSR}(X_1) = 352.27$, $\text{SSE}(X_1) = 143.12$
- $Y$ on $X_2$ only  
- $Y$ on $X_1, X_2$: $\text{SSR}(X_1,X_2) = 385.44$, $\text{SSE}(X_1,X_2) = 109.95$
- $Y$ on $X_1,X_2,X_3$: $\text{SSR}(X_1,X_2,X_3) = 396.98$, $\text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3) = 98.41$

### Extra Sum of Squares

Note $\text{SSE}(X_1,X_2) = 109.95 < \text{SSE}(X_1) = 143.12$. The **extra sum of squares** measures the reduction when adding $X_2$ given $X_1$ already in model:

$$
\text{SSR}(X_2|X_1) = \text{SSE}(X_1) - \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2) = 143.12 - 109.95 = 33.17
$$

Equivalently:
$$
\text{SSR}(X_2|X_1) = \text{SSR}(X_1,X_2) - \text{SSR}(X_1) = 385.44 - 352.27 = 33.17
$$

This follows from ANOVA identity $\text{SSTO} = \text{SSR} + \text{SSE}$.

### Regression Summary Tables

```

### Additional Extra Sums of Squares

**Adding $X_3$ given $X_1,X_2$:**
$$
\text{SSR}(X_3|X_1,X_2) = 109.95 - 98.41 = 11.54
$$

**Adding $X_2,X_3$ given $X_1$:**
$$
\text{SSR}(X_2,X_3|X_1) = 143.12 - 98.41 = 44.71
$$





### Definitions 
The notation $SSR(X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)$ typically denotes the SSR when all predictors $X_1, \dots, X_p$ are in the model.
* **$SSR(X_1)$:** The regression sum of squares when only $X_1$ is in the model.
* **$SSR(X_2|X_1)$:** The extra sum of squares associated with adding $X_2$ to a model that already contains $X_1$. This is the reduction in SSE when $X_2$ is added to the model with $X_1$.
* **$SSR(X_1|X_2)$:** The extra sum of squares associated with adding $X_1$ to a model that already contains $X_2$. This is generally *not* equal to $SSR(X_2|X_1)$ unless $X_1$ and $X_2$ are uncorrelated.
* **$SSR(X_2, X_3 | X_1)$:** The extra sum of squares associated with adding $X_2$ and $X_3$ to a model that already contains $X_1$.

### Decomposition of SSR into Extra Sums of Squares (Page 260)
The total SSR for a model with multiple predictors can be decomposed into extra sums of squares. The order of inclusion matters for the individual components.
For a model with $X_1$ and $X_2$:
$SSR(X_1, X_2) = SSR(X_1) + SSR(X_2|X_1)$
Alternatively:
$SSR(X_1, X_2) = SSR(X_2) + SSR(X_1|X_2)$

This demonstrates that the total SSR is the same regardless of the order, but the individual "extra" contributions ($SSR(X_2|X_1)$ vs. $SSR(X_1|X_2)$) depend on the order in which predictors are considered for their marginal contribution.

## ANOVA Table Decomposition Using Extra Sums of Squares

ANOVA tables decompose the regression sum of squares (SSR) into **extra sums of squares** for sequential variable addition. Table 7.4 shows this for the body fat example:

### Table 7.4: ANOVA Decomposition - Body Fat Example

| Source of Variation     | SS      | df | MS     |
|-------------------------|---------|----|--------|
| **Regression**          | 396.98  | 3  | 132.33 |
| $X_1$                   | 352.27  | 1  | 352.27 |
| $X_2 \mid X_1$          | 33.17   | 1  | 33.17  |
| $X_3 \mid X_1, X_2$     | 11.54   | 1  | 11.54  |
| **Error**               | 98.41   | 16 | 6.15   |
| **Total**               | 495.39  | 19 |        |

### Key Properties

**Single variable extra SS**: Each has **1 degree of freedom**
```
MSR(X₂|X₁) = SSR(X₂|X₁) / 1 = 33.17 / 1 = 33.17
```

**Multiple variables extra SS**: Sum of single-degree-of-freedom terms
$$
\text{SSR}(X_2, X_3 \mid X_1) = \text{SSR}(X_2 \mid X_1) + \text{SSR}(X_3 \mid X_1, X_2)
$$
$$
\text{SSR}(X_2, X_3 \mid X_1) = 33.17 + 11.54 = 44.71 \quad (2 \, \text{df})
$$

### Computer Package Output

Most regression packages provide **sequential extra SS** in entry order:

**Order: $X_1, X_2, X_3$**
```
SSR(X₁)          = 352.27  (1 df)
SSR(X₂|X₁)       = 33.17   (1 df)  
SSR(X₃|X₁,X₂)    = 11.54   (1 df)
```

**To get SSR(X₁, X₃|X₂)**: Enter variables as **X₂, X₁, X₃**
```
SSR(X₂)          = 381.97
SSR(X₁|X₂)       = 14.47
SSR(X₃|X₂,X₁)    = 11.54
```
Then: $\text{SSR}(X_1, X_3 \mid X_2) = 14.47 + 11.54 = 26.01$

### Why Extra SS Matter

Extra sums of squares test whether specific variables can be **dropped** from the model:
- $\text{SSR}(X_3 \mid X_1, X_2) = 11.54$ tests $H_0: \beta_3 = 0 \mid \beta_1, \beta_2$
- Small values suggest the variable adds little explanatory power given others

## 7.2 Uses of Extra Sums of Squares in Tests for Regression Coefficients 

Extra sums of squares are the building blocks for flexible F-tests concerning the regression coefficients.

### Test whether a Single $\beta_k = 0$ 
To test if a single coefficient $\beta_k$ is zero (i.e., if $X_k$ contributes significantly to the model *given all other predictors are already in the model*), we use an F-test:
## Testing Individual Coefficients Using Extra Sums of Squares

### Test Setup
Test if $\beta_k X_k$ can be dropped:
- **$H_0: \beta_k = 0$**
- **$H_a: \beta_k \neq 0$**

**t-test** (Section 6.51b):
$$
t^* = \frac{\hat{b}_k}{s\{\hat{b}_k\}}
$$

### F-test via General Linear Test (Section 2.8)

**Full model** (3 predictors):
$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3
$$
SSE$(F)$, df$_F = n-4$

**Reduced model** ($H_0: \beta_3 = 0$):
$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \epsilon_i
$$
SSE$(R) = \text{SSE}(X_1, X_2)$, df$_R = n-3$

**General F-test** (2.70):
$$
F^* = \frac{(\text{SSE}(R) - \text{SSE}(F))/(df_R - df_F)}{\text{SSE}(F)/df_F}
$$

### Connection to Extra Sum of Squares

Numerator difference = **extra SS**:
$$
\text{SSE}(R) - \text{SSE}(F) = \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2) - \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3) = \text{SSR}(X_3|X_1,X_2)
$$

**Final F-statistic** (7.15):
$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSR}(X_3|X_1,X_2)/1}{\text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)/(n-4)} = \frac{\text{MSR}(X_3|X_1,X_2)}{\text{MSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)}
$$

**Key properties:**
- **Marginal test**: Tests $\beta_3 = 0$ *given* $X_1, X_2$ in model
- **1 df** for single extra SS
- **No separate reduced model needed** - single full model run suffices

### Body Fat Example

Test dropping $X_3$ (midarm circumference):

From Table 7.4:
$$
F^* = \frac{11.54/1}{98.41/16} = \frac{11.54}{6.15} = 1.88
$$

**Decision** ($\alpha = 0.01$): $F_{0.99}(1,16) = 8.53$
- $1.88 < 8.53$ → **Accept $H_0$**: Drop $X_3$

**t-test equivalent** (Table 7.2d):
$$
t^* = \frac{\hat{b}_3}{s\{\hat{b}_3\}} = \frac{-2.186}{1.596} = -1.37
$$
$$
(t^*)^2 = (-1.37)^2 = 1.88 = F^*
$$

### Summary
- **t-test** and **F-test equivalent**: $(t^*)^2 = F^*$
- **Extra SS practical**: Single regression output provides all needed statistics
- **Sequential testing**: Order of variable entry determines which marginal effects are computed


### Test whether Several $\beta_k = 0$ 
This is a powerful general linear hypothesis test. It tests whether a *subset* of regression coefficients are simultaneously zero, given that other predictor variables are already in the model.
* **Full Model:** Includes all predictor variables relevant to the test.
* **Reduced Model:** A sub-model derived from the full model by setting the coefficients of the variables being tested to zero (i.e., removing those variables).
## Testing Multiple Coefficients Simultaneously

Test if **both** $\beta_2 X_2$ and $\beta_3 X_3$ can be dropped from full model (7.12):

**$H_0: \beta_2 = \beta_3 = 0$**  
**$H_a:$ not both zero** (7.16)

### General Linear Test

**Full model:**
$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \beta_3 X_3
$$
SSE$(F) = \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)$, df$_F = n-4$

**Reduced model** (7.17):
$$
E(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \epsilon_i
$$
SSE$(R) = \text{SSE}(X_1)$, df$_R = n-2$

**F-statistic** (2.70):
$$
F^* = \frac{(\text{SSE}(R)-\text{SSE}(F))/(df_R-df_F)}{\text{SSE}(F)/df_F}
$$
$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSE}(X_1) - \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)}{2} \div \frac{\text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)}{n-4}
$$

### Extra Sum of Squares Form (7.18)

Numerator = joint extra SS:
$$
\text{SSE}(X_1) - \text{SSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3) = \text{SSR}(X_2,X_3 \mid X_1)
$$

$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSR}(X_2,X_3 \mid X_1)/2}{\text{MSE}(X_1,X_2,X_3)} = \frac{\text{MSR}(X_2,X_3 \mid X_1)}{\text{MSE}}
$$

**2 degrees of freedom** for two tested coefficients.

### Body Fat Example

Test dropping **both** $X_2$ (thigh) and $X_3$ (midarm) given $X_1$:

From Table 7.4 and (7.11):
$$
\text{SSR}(X_2,X_3 \mid X_1) = \text{SSR}(X_2|X_1) + \text{SSR}(X_3|X_1,X_2)
$$
$$
= 33.17 + 11.54 = 44.71 \quad (2 \, \text{df})
$$

**F-statistic:**
$$
F^* = \frac{44.71/2}{98.41/16} = \frac{22.355}{6.15} = 3.63
$$

**Decision** ($\alpha = 0.05$): $F_{0.95}(2,16) = 3.63$
- $F^* = 3.63 =$ critical value → **P-value = 0.05**
- **Boundary case**: Additional analysis recommended before dropping $X_2, X_3$


## 7.3 Summary of Tests Concerning Regression Coefficients
## Summary of Common F-Tests in Multiple Regression

### 1. Overall F-Test: All $\beta_k = 0$ (6.39)

**$H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = \dots = \beta_{p-1} = 0$**  
**$H_a:$ not all zero** (7.21)

$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSR}(X_1,\dots,X_{p-1})}{\text{SSE}(X_1,\dots,X_{p-1})} = \frac{\text{MSR}}{\text{MSE}}
$$
**df**: $(p-1, n-p)$

### 2. Single Coefficient: $\beta_k = 0$

**$H_0: \beta_k = 0$, $H_a: \beta_k \neq 0$**

**Partial F-test** (7.23):
$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSR}(X_k \mid X_1,\dots,X_{k-1},X_{k+1},\dots,X_{p-1})}{\text{SSE}(X_1,\dots,X_{p-1})}
$$
**df**: $(1, n-p)$

**Equivalent t-test** (6.51b, 7.25):
$$
t^* = \frac{\hat{b}_k}{s\{\hat{b}_k\}} \quad (t^*)^2 = F^*
$$

### 3. Subset of Coefficients: Some $\beta_k = 0$ (7.26)

**$H_0: \beta_q = \dots = \beta_{p-1} = 0$**  
**$H_a:$ not all zero**

$$
F^* = \frac{\text{SSR}(X_q,\dots,X_{p-1} \mid X_1,\dots,X_{q-1})}{\text{SSE}(\text{full model})}
$$
**df**: $(p-q, n-p)$

**Sequential sum** (7.28):
$$
\text{SSR}(X_q,\dots,X_{p-1} \mid X_1,\dots,X_{q-1}) = \sum \text{SSR}(\text{individual terms})
$$

### Alternative Form Using $R^2$ (7.29)

$$
F^* = \frac{(R^2_{\text{full}} - R^2_{\text{reduced}})/(p-q)}{(1-R^2_{\text{full}})/(n-p)}
$$

## Other Tests (Require Full + Reduced Model Fits)

### Linear Restrictions (7.31)

**Full model:**
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1i} + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \epsilon_i
$$

**Test $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2$** → Reduced:
$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_c (X_{1i} + X_{2i}) + \beta_3 X_{3i} + \epsilon_i
$$
**df**: $(1, n-4)$

### Specific Values (7.33)

**Test $H_0: \beta_1 = 3, \beta_3 = 5$** → Reduced:
$$
Y_i - 3X_{1i} - 5X_{3i} = \beta_0 + \beta_2 X_{2i} + \epsilon_i
$$
**df**: $(2, n-4)$

## Key Takeaway

| Test Type | Extra SS Available? | df Numerator |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| All $\beta_k=0$ | Yes (full SSR) | $p-1$ |
| Single $\beta_k=0$ | Yes | $1$ |
| Subset $\beta$'s | Yes (sequential) | $p-q$ |
| Linear restrictions | **No** | Depends |
| Specific values | **No** | Depends |


## 7.4 Coefficients of Partial Determination (Page 268)

Partial determination coefficients quantify the proportion of variability in the dependent variable that is explained by one predictor (or a set of predictors) *after accounting for the effects of other predictors already in the model*.

### Two Predictor Variables (Page 269)
* **$r_{Y1.2}^2$:** The coefficient of partial determination between $Y$ and $X_1$, given $X_2$.
    It's interpreted as the proportion of the variation in $Y$ that is *not explained by $X_2$* that *is explained by $X_1$*.
    Formula: $r_{Y1.2}^2 = \frac{SSR(X_1|X_2)}{SSE(X_2)} = \frac{SSR(X_1|X_2)}{SST - SSR(X_2)}$.

### General Case (Page 269)
For a predictor $X_k$, the coefficient of partial determination $R_{Yk.\text{others}}^2$ is the proportion of the variation in $Y$ not explained by the "other" predictor variables that is explained by $X_k$.
Formula: $R_{Yk.\text{others}}^2 = \frac{SSR(X_k | \text{all other } X\text{s})}{SSE(\text{model excluding } X_k)}$.
This value is closely related to the $t$-statistic for $b_k$.

### Coefficients of Partial Correlation (Page 270)
The **coefficient of partial correlation** ($r_{Yk.\text{others}}$) is the square root of the coefficient of partial determination. It takes the sign of the corresponding regression coefficient $b_k$.
* It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between $Y$ and $X_k$, *after controlling for the linear effects of all other predictor variables*.
* This is distinct from the simple (marginal) correlation between $Y$ and $X_k$, which does not account for other predictors. Partial correlations are particularly useful in understanding the unique contribution of a predictor variable.

## 7.5 Standardized Multiple Regression Model (Page 271)

### Roundoff Errors in Normal Equations Calculations (Page 271)
When predictor variables have vastly different scales or magnitudes, the elements in the $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ matrix can become very large or very small. This can lead to numerical instability and increased roundoff errors during the computation of $(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}$ by statistical software. Standardizing variables can mitigate this.

### Lack of Comparability in Regression Coefficients (Page 272)
In an unstandardized multiple regression model, the magnitude of the $b_k$ coefficients cannot be directly compared to assess the relative importance of predictor variables. This is because $b_k$ reflects the change in $Y$ for a one-unit change in $X_k$, and a 'one-unit change' has different meanings for variables measured on different scales (e.g., a one-unit change in 'age' vs. a one-unit change in 'income' ($).

### Correlation Transformation (Page 272)
To make coefficients comparable and improve numerical stability, variables are often subjected to a **correlation transformation** (also known as Z-score standardization).
For each variable (including $Y$ and all $X_k$s), the transformation is:
$Y_i^* = (Y_i - \bar{Y}) / s_Y$
$X_{ik}^* = (X_{ik} - \bar{X}_k) / s_k$
Where $s_Y$ and $s_k$ are the sample standard deviations of $Y$ and $X_k$, respectively.
The transformed variables $Y^*$ and $X^*$ have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

### Standardized Regression Model (Page 273)
The regression model fitted using these standardized variables is the **standardized regression model**:
$Y_i^* = \beta_1^* X_{i1}^* + \beta_2^* X_{i2}^* + \dots + \beta_{p-1}^* X_{i,p-1}^* + \epsilon_i^*$
Note: The intercept $\beta_0^*$ is typically 0 in the standardized model (since means are 0).

### $\mathbf{X}'\mathbf{X}$ Matrix for Transformed Variables (Page 274)
When variables are correlation-transformed, the $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ matrix in the standardized model (ignoring the column of ones as $\beta_0^*$ is 0) becomes the **correlation matrix of the predictor variables**. This is numerically well-behaved.

### Estimated Standardized Regression Coefficients (Page 275)
The coefficients from the standardized model are denoted as $\mathbf{b}^*$ or $\beta_k^*$.
* **Interpretation:** A standardized regression coefficient $b_k^*$ indicates the change in the number of **standard deviations of $Y$** for a one-standard deviation increase in $X_k$, holding all other standardized predictors constant.
* **Comparability:** Because all variables are on the same standard deviation scale, the magnitudes of the $b_k^*$ coefficients *can* be compared to gauge the relative importance of predictor variables in influencing $Y$.
* **Conversion:** Standardized coefficients can be converted back to unstandardized coefficients and vice-versa.
    $b_k = b_k^* \cdot (s_Y / s_k)$
    $b_0 = \bar{Y} - \sum_{k=1}^{p-1} b_k \bar{X}_k$

## 7.6 Multicollinearity and Its Effects (Page 278)

**Multicollinearity** refers to the situation in multiple regression where two or more predictor variables are highly correlated with each other. It poses a significant challenge to the interpretation and stability of the regression model.

### Uncorrelated Predictor Variables (Page 279)
This is an ideal (but rare in observational studies) scenario. If predictor variables are perfectly uncorrelated (orthogonal), then:
* The regression coefficients $b_k$ are independent of which other predictors are in the model.
* The extra sum of squares $SSR(X_k | \text{other } X\text{s})$ would simply be $SSR(X_k)$.
* Coefficient estimates are highly stable and precise.
* Interpretation of individual coefficients is straightforward.
* This is often achieved in designed experiments (e.g., using orthogonal designs).

### Nature of Problem when Predictor Variables Are Perfectly Correlated (Page 281)
**Perfect Multicollinearity** occurs when one predictor variable is an exact linear combination of one or more other predictor variables.
* **Cause:** This happens if, for example, you include dummy variables for *all* categories of a categorical variable *and* an intercept in the model (the sum of dummies equals the intercept's column of ones). Or, if you include a variable and its exact duplicate.
* **Consequence:** The $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ matrix becomes **singular** (its determinant is zero), meaning its inverse $(\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}$ does **not exist**. Consequently, the least squares estimates $\mathbf{b} = (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1} \mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ cannot be uniquely determined. Statistical software will usually issue an error and drop one of the perfectly correlated variables.

### Effects of Multicollinearity (Page 283)
Even when multicollinearity is not perfect but **high** (i.e., predictors are highly correlated but not perfectly), it causes several practical problems:
1.  **Large Standard Errors for $b_k$:** The most prominent effect. High correlation among predictors makes it difficult for the model to isolate the unique contribution of each, leading to inflated variances of the coefficient estimates ($Var\{\mathbf{b}\} = \sigma^2 (\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X})^{-1}$). This results in large standard errors, wide confidence intervals, and consequently, individual t-tests that show individual predictors as not statistically significant, even if the overall model (F-test) is significant.
2.  **Unstable Coefficients:** The estimated coefficients $b_k$ become highly sensitive to small changes in the data or the inclusion/exclusion of other predictor variables. Adding or removing a few observations can drastically change the coefficient values.
3.  **Unexpected Signs or Magnitudes:** Coefficients may have signs opposite to what is expected based on theory or previous research, or their magnitudes may be unreasonably large or small.
4.  **Difficulty in Interpretation:** It becomes hard to interpret an individual $b_k$ as the change in $Y$ holding other predictors constant, because when predictors are highly correlated, it's difficult to vary one while keeping others truly constant.
5.  **High $R^2$ but Few Significant Individual Predictors:** The model might explain a large portion of the variance in $Y$ (high $R^2$), but individual t-tests for coefficients are often non-significant. This is because the predictors, as a group, explain a lot, but their individual contributions are indistinguishable due to their collinearity.

### Need for More Powerful Diagnostics for Multicollinearity (Page 289)
Simple pairwise correlation coefficients are insufficient to detect multicollinearity, as it can involve linear relationships among three or more variables simultaneously. This necessitates more sophisticated diagnostics:
* **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** A widely used metric that quantifies how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient is inflated due to collinearity with other predictors. VIF values greater than 5 or 10 typically indicate problematic multicollinearity.
* **Tolerance:** The reciprocal of VIF (1/VIF). Values close to 0 indicate high multicollinearity.
* **Eigenvalues of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{X}$ and Condition Index:** These provide a more holistic view of the correlation structure among predictors and can identify specific patterns of multicollinearity. (Often discussed in detail in Chapter 8).

Understanding multicollinearity is crucial because it directly impacts the reliability and interpretability of the multiple regression model, potentially leading to incorrect conclusions about the effects of individual predictors.
