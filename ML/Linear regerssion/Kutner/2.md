# Chapter 2: Inferences in Simple Linear Regression

## Numerical Example Setup

Let's use a small dataset to illustrate the calculations for a simple linear regression model.
**Scenario:** A small business wants to study the relationship between its **Advertising Spend (X, in $100s)** and **Weekly Sales (Y, in $1000s)**.

| Observation (i) | X (Ads, $100s) | Y (Sales, $1000s) |
| :-------------- | :------------- | :---------------- |
| 1               | 2              | 5                 |
| 2               | 3              | 7                 |
| 3               | 4              | 8                 |
| 4               | 5              | 10                |
| 5               | 6              | 12                |
| **n = 5** |                |                   |

**Key Calculated Values from our data:**

* Number of observations ($n$) = 5
* Sum of $X_i$: $\sum X_i = 20$
* Sum of $Y_i$: $\sum Y_i = 42$
* Mean of $X$: $\bar{X} = \sum X_i / n = 20 / 5 = 4$
* Mean of $Y$: $\bar{Y} = \sum Y_i / n = 42 / 5 = 8.4$
* Sum of squares for $X$: $\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$
    * (Alternatively: $\sum X_i^2 - n\bar{X}^2 = 90 - 5(4^2) = 90 - 80 = 10$)
* Sum of products of deviations: $\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y}) = 17$
    * (Alternatively: $\sum X_i Y_i - n\bar{X}\bar{Y} = 185 - 5(4)(8.4) = 185 - 168 = 17$)

**Estimated Regression Line:** $\hat{Y} = b_0 + b_1 X$

* **Estimated slope ($b_1$):**
    $b_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} = \frac{17}{10} = 1.7$
* **Estimated intercept ($b_0$):**
    $b_0 = \bar{Y} - b_1 \bar{X} = 8.4 - 1.7(4) = 8.4 - 6.8 = 1.6$

So, our fitted regression equation is: $\hat{Y} = 1.6 + 1.7X$

**Residuals and SSE:**

| X | Y | $\hat{Y} = 1.6 + 1.7X$ | Residual ($e = Y - \hat{Y}$) | $e^2$ |
| :- | :- | :-------------------- | :--------------------------- | :---- |
| 2 | 5 | $1.6 + 1.7(2) = 5.0$  | $5 - 5.0 = 0.0$              | $0.00$ |
| 3 | 7 | $1.6 + 1.7(3) = 6.7$  | $7 - 6.7 = 0.3$              | $0.09$ |
| 4 | 8 | $1.6 + 1.7(4) = 8.4$  | $8 - 8.4 = -0.4$             | $0.16$ |
| 5 | 10 | $1.6 + 1.7(5) = 10.1$ | $10 - 10.1 = -0.1$           | $0.01$ |
| 6 | 12 | $1.6 + 1.7(6) = 11.8$ | $12 - 11.8 = 0.2$            | $0.04$ |
|   |   |                       | $\sum e = 0.0$               | $SSE = 0.30$ |

**Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
$s^2 = MSE = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = \frac{0.30}{5-2} = \frac{0.30}{3} = 0.10$

**Estimated Standard Deviation of Errors (s):**
$s = \sqrt{MSE} = \sqrt{0.10} \approx 0.3162$

These values will be used for all subsequent calculations.

## 2.1 Inferences Concerning $\beta_1$

## Inference About the Slope $\beta_1$ in Simple Linear Regression

In simple linear regression, we are frequently interested in drawing inferences about  
$\beta_1$, the **slope of the regression line** in model (2.1), because it measures the
average change in the response variable $Y$ for a one-unit increase in the predictor $X$.
For example, in a study of **sales ($Y$)** versus **advertising expenditure ($X$)**,
$\beta_1$ represents the average increase in sales revenue generated by spending one
additional dollar on advertising.

A common and important hypothesis test concerning the slope is:

$$
H_0 : \beta_1 = 0
\qquad \text{versus} \qquad
H_a : \beta_1 \neq 0
$$

The motivation for this test is that when $\beta_1 = 0$, there is **no linear association**
between $Y$ and $X$. In this case, the regression function reduces to:

$$
E\{Y\} = \beta_0 + (0)X = \beta_0
$$

which implies that the regression line is **horizontal**. Consequently, the mean of $Y$
is the same for all values of $X$.

For the **normal error regression model**, the implication of $\beta_1 = 0$ is even
stronger. Since the model assumes:
- normal distributions for $Y$ at each level of $X$,
- constant variance $\sigma^2$, and
- equal means when $\beta_1 = 0$,

it follows that the **entire probability distribution of $Y$ is identical for all values
of $X$**. Thus, under this model, $\beta_1 = 0$ implies not only that there is no linear
association, but that there is **no relationship of any type** between $Y$ and $X$.

Because hypothesis tests and confidence intervals for $\beta_1$ depend on its estimator
$b_1$, it is essential to study the **sampling distribution of $b_1$**, which forms the
foundation for statistical inference about the slope of the regression line.


### Sampling Distribution of $b_1$

## Sampling Distribution of $b_1$

The point estimator of the slope $\beta_1$ in simple linear regression is given by:

$$
b_1 = \frac{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \tag{2.2}
$$

The **sampling distribution of $b_1$** refers to the distribution of values that $b_1$ would
take over repeated samples, **holding the predictor levels $X_i$ fixed** from sample to
sample.

---

### Distribution, Mean, and Variance of $b_1$

For the **normal error regression model (2.1)**, the sampling distribution of $b_1$ is
**normal**, with:

$$
E\{b_1\} = \beta_1 \tag{2.3a}
$$

$$
\{Var}\{b_1\} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \tag{2.3b}
$$

Thus, $b_1$ is an **unbiased estimator** of $\beta_1$, and its variability decreases as the
spread of the $X_i$ values increases.

---

### $b_1$ as a Linear Combination of the $Y_i$

The estimator $b_1$ can be written as a **linear combination of the responses $Y_i$**:

$$
b_1 = \sum k_i Y_i \tag{2.4}
$$

where the coefficients $k_i$ are defined as:

$$
k_i = \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \tag{2.4a}
$$

Since the $X_i$ values are fixed, the $k_i$ are fixed constants. This representation is
fundamental because it allows us to derive the distributional properties of $b_1$.

---

### Properties of the Coefficients $k_i$

The coefficients $k_i$ satisfy several important properties:

$$
\sum k_i = 0 \tag{2.5}
$$

$$
\sum k_i X_i = 1 \tag{2.6}
$$

$$
\sum k_i^2 = \frac{1}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \tag{2.7}
$$

These properties follow directly from the definition of $k_i$ and the fact that:

$$
\sum (X_i - \bar{X}) = 0 \tag{2.8}
$$

Using these properties, the expression for $b_1$ in (2.4) is algebraically equivalent to the
least-squares form in (2.2).

---

### Normality of the Sampling Distribution

Because:
- each $Y_i$ is independently and normally distributed under model (2.1), and  
- $b_1$ is a linear combination of the $Y_i$,

it follows that **$b_1$ is normally distributed**. This result follows from the general rule
that a linear combination of independent normal random variables is itself normally
distributed.

---

### Mean of $b_1$

Using linearity of expectation:

$$
E\{b_1\} = E\left\{\sum k_i Y_i\right\}
= \sum k_i E\{Y_i\}
= \sum k_i (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i)
$$

$$
= \beta_0 \sum k_i + \beta_1 \sum k_i X_i
$$

Applying properties (2.5) and (2.6), we obtain:

$$
E\{b_1\} = \beta_1
$$

Thus, $b_1$ is an **unbiased estimator** of the slope.

---

### Variance of $b_1$

Since the $Y_i$ are independent with variance $\sigma^2$ and the $k_i$ are constants:

$$
\operatorname{Var}\{b_1\}
= \operatorname{Var}\left\{\sum k_i Y_i\right\}
= \sum k_i^2 \sigma^2
$$

Using property (2.7):

$$
\operatorname{Var}\{b_1\}
= \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2}
$$

---

### Estimated Variance of $b_1$

The variance of $b_1$ is estimated by replacing $\sigma^2$ with its unbiased estimator
$\text{MSE}$:

$$
s^2\{b_1\} = \frac{\text{MSE}}{\sum (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \tag{2.9}
$$

The standard error of $b_1$ is then:

$$
s\{b_1\} = \sqrt{s^2\{b_1\}}
$$

---

### Minimum Variance Property (Gauss–Markov Result)

Consider any unbiased linear estimator of $\beta_1$ of the form:

$$
\tilde{\beta}_1 = \sum C_i Y_i
$$

Unbiasedness requires the constraints:

$$
\sum C_i = 0, \qquad \sum C_i X_i = 1
$$

Let $C_i = k_i + d_i$, where $k_i$ are the least-squares coefficients and $d_i$ are arbitrary
constants satisfying the constraints. Then:

$$
\operatorname{Var}\{\tilde{\beta}_1\}
= \sigma^2 \sum (k_i + d_i)^2
= \sigma^2 \sum k_i^2 + \sigma^2 \sum d_i^2
$$

Since $\sum d_i^2 \ge 0$, the variance is minimized **only when $d_i = 0$ for all $i$**, which
implies $C_i = k_i$.

Therefore, the least squares estimator $b_1$ has **minimum variance among all unbiased
linear estimators of $\beta_1$**.

Under the normal error regression model, the least squares estimator $b_1$ has a sampling distribution with the following properties:
* **Unbiased:** $E\{b_1\} = \beta_1$. This means that if we were to take many samples and calculate $b_1$ for each, the average of these $b_1$ values would equal the true population slope $\beta_1$.
* **Variance:** The variance of the sampling distribution of $b_1$ is:
    $\text{Var}(b_1) = \sigma^2\{b_1\} = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$
    Since $\sigma^2$ is unknown, we estimate $\text{Var}(b_1)$ by replacing $\sigma^2$ with $s^2$:
    $s^2\{b_1\} = \frac{s^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}$
    The estimated standard deviation of $b_1$ (its standard error) is $s\{b_1\} = \sqrt{s^2\{b_1\}}$.
* **Distribution:** $b_1$ is normally distributed: $b_1 \sim N(\beta_1, \sigma^2\{b_1\})$.

**Example Calculation of $s\{b_1\}$:**
From our example: $s^2 = 0.10$ and $\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$.
$s^2\{b_1\} = \frac{0.10}{10} = 0.01$
$s\{b_1\} = \sqrt{0.01} = 0.10$


### Sampling Distribution of $(b_1 - \beta_1)/s\{b_1\}$

When $\sigma^2$ is unknown and estimated by $s^2$, the standardized variable follows a $t$-distribution.
$t^* = \frac{b_1 - \beta_1}{s\{b_1\}}$
This $t^*$ statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom. This is because $s^2$ (which is used to calculate $s\{b_1\}$) has $n-2$ degrees of freedom.

### Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$

A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the true population parameter $\beta_1$.
The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is given by:

$b_1 \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2) s\{b_1\}$

Where:
* $b_1$: The point estimate of the slope.
* $t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)$: The critical value from the $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom, corresponding to the desired confidence level.
* $s\{b_1\}$: The estimated standard error of $b_1$.

**Example Calculation of 95% Confidence Interval for $\beta_1$:**
* $b_1 = 1.7$
* $s\{b_1\} = 0.10$
* $n-2 = 5-2 = 3$ degrees of freedom.
* For a 95% CI, $\alpha = 0.05$, so $\alpha/2 = 0.025$. We need $t(0.975; 3)$. From a t-table, $t(0.975; 3) = 3.182$.

$CI = 1.7 \pm 3.182 \times 0.10$
$CI = 1.7 \pm 0.3182$
Lower bound: $1.7 - 0.3182 = 1.3818$
Upper bound: $1.7 + 0.3182 = 2.0182$

The 95% confidence interval for $\beta_1$ is $[1.3818, 2.0182]$.
**Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that the true increase in weekly sales (in $1000s) for every additional $100 spent on advertising lies between $138.18 and $201.82.

### Tests Concerning $\beta_1$

We often want to test hypotheses about the slope parameter, most commonly whether there is a linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$.

**Hypotheses:**
* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** $\beta_1 = 0$ (There is no linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$; $X$ has no linear effect on $Y$).
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_a$):** $\beta_1 \neq 0$ (There is a linear relationship; $X$ has a linear effect on $Y$). (Two-sided test)
    * Alternatively, one-sided tests could be used, e.g., $H_a: \beta_1 > 0$ or $H_a: \beta_1 < 0$.

**Test Statistic:**
$t^* = \frac{b_1 - 0}{s\{b_1\}} = \frac{b_1}{s\{b_1\}}$
Under $H_0$, this statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.

**Decision Rule (at significance level $\alpha$):**
* **P-value approach:** If p-value $\le \alpha$, reject $H_0$.
* **Critical value approach:** If $|t^*| > t(1-\alpha/2; n-2)$, reject $H_0$.

**Example Calculation of Test for $\beta_1 = 0$ (at $\alpha = 0.05$):**
* $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$
* $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0$
* $b_1 = 1.7$
* $s\{b_1\} = 0.10$
* $t^* = \frac{1.7}{0.10} = 17.0$
* Degrees of freedom = $n-2 = 3$.
* Critical value for $\alpha = 0.05$ (two-tailed) is $t(0.975; 3) = 3.182$.

Since $|t^*| = 17.0 > 3.182$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.
**Conclusion:** There is strong statistical evidence to conclude that there is a significant linear relationship between advertising spend and weekly sales.

---

## 2.2 Inferences Concerning $\beta_0$

Inferences for the intercept $\beta_0$ are conducted similarly to those for $\beta_1$.

### Sampling Distribution of $b_0$

* **Unbiased:** $E\{b_0\} = \beta_0$.
* **Variance:**
    $\text{Var}(b_0) = \sigma^2\{b_0\} = \sigma^2 \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{X}^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
    Estimated variance:
    $s^2\{b_0\} = s^2 \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{X}^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
    Standard error: $s\{b_0\} = \sqrt{s^2\{b_0\}}$.
* **Distribution:** $b_0$ is normally distributed: $b_0 \sim N(\beta_0, \sigma^2\{b_0\})$.

**Example Calculation of $s\{b_0\}$:**
From our example: $s^2 = 0.10$, $n=5$, $\bar{X}=4$, $\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$.
$s^2\{b_0\} = 0.10 \left[ \frac{1}{5} + \frac{4^2}{10} \right]$
$s^2\{b_0\} = 0.10 \left[ 0.2 + \frac{16}{10} \right]$
$s^2\{b_0\} = 0.10 \left[ 0.2 + 1.6 \right] = 0.10(1.8) = 0.18$
$s\{b_0\} = \sqrt{0.18} \approx 0.4243$

### Sampling Distribution of $(b_0 - \beta_0)/s\{b_0\}$

$t^* = \frac{b_0 - \beta_0}{s\{b_0\}}$
This statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.

### Confidence Interval for $\beta_0$

The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for $\beta_0$ is:

$b_0 \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2) s\{b_0\}$

**Example Calculation of 95% Confidence Interval for $\beta_0$:**
* $b_0 = 1.6$
* $s\{b_0\} = 0.4243$
* $n-2 = 3$ degrees of freedom.
* $t(0.975; 3) = 3.182$.

$CI = 1.6 \pm 3.182 \times 0.4243$
$CI = 1.6 \pm 1.3503$
Lower bound: $1.6 - 1.3503 = 0.2497$
Upper bound: $1.6 + 1.3503 = 2.9503$

The 95% confidence interval for $\beta_0$ is $[0.2497, 2.9503]$.
**Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that the true mean weekly sales (in $1000s) when advertising spend is zero (0) lies between $249.7 and $2950.3. *Note:* Interpreting $\beta_0$ when $X=0$ is outside the scope of observed $X$ values or is not meaningful, should be done with caution. In our example, 0 advertising spend is meaningful.

---

## 2.3 Some Considerations on Making Inferences Concerning $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ (Page 50)

1.  **Effects of Departures from Normality:** The assumption of normally distributed errors is primarily important for the validity of $t$-tests and confidence intervals, especially for small sample sizes. If the errors are only moderately non-normal, the methods are often robust (meaning they still perform reasonably well). However, severe non-normality can invalidate the inferences. The Central Limit Theorem suggests that for large sample sizes, the sampling distributions of $b_0$ and $b_1$ will tend towards normality regardless of the error distribution.
2.  **Interpretation of Confidence Coefficient and Risks of Errors:**
    * **Confidence Coefficient:** A $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval means that if we were to repeatedly sample and construct such intervals, $(1-\alpha)100\%$ of these intervals would contain the true population parameter. It does *not* mean there's a $(1-\alpha)100\%$ chance the *current* interval contains the parameter.
    * **Risks of Errors:** In hypothesis testing, $\alpha$ is the Type I error rate (probability of rejecting a true $H_0$), and $\beta$ (not to be confused with slope parameter) is the Type II error rate (probability of failing to reject a false $H_0$).
3.  **Spacing of the X Levels:** The precision of the estimates $b_0$ and $b_1$ is heavily influenced by the spread of the independent variable $X$.
    * A larger spread in $X$ (i.e., a larger $\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2$) leads to smaller standard errors for $b_1$ and $\hat{Y}_h$ (especially for $X_h$ far from $\bar{X}$). This means more precise estimates.
    * Optimal design often involves spacing $X$ values widely, within the relevant range.
4.  **Power of Tests:** The power of a statistical test (1 - $\beta$) is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. Power depends on:
    * **Sample Size (n):** Larger $n$ generally leads to higher power.
    * **Significance Level ($\alpha$):** Increasing $\alpha$ increases power.
    * **Effect Size:** The true magnitude of the effect ($\beta_1$ being far from 0). Larger effects are easier to detect.
    * **Error Variance ($\sigma^2$):** Smaller $\sigma^2$ (less noise) leads to higher power.

---

## 2.4 Interval Estimation of $E\{Y_h\}$ (Mean Response)

We can use the fitted regression line to estimate the *mean* response for a specific value of $X$, say $X_h$.

### Sampling Distribution of $\hat{Y}_h$

The predicted mean response $\hat{Y}_h = b_0 + b_1 X_h$ has the following properties:
* **Unbiased:** $E\{\hat{Y}_h\} = E\{Y_h|X_h\} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_h$.
* **Variance:**
    $\text{Var}(\hat{Y}_h) = \sigma^2\{\hat{Y}_h\} = \sigma^2 \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
    Estimated variance:
    $s^2\{\hat{Y}_h\} = s^2 \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
    Standard error: $s\{\hat{Y}_h\} = \sqrt{s^2\{\hat{Y}_h\}}$.
* **Distribution:** $\hat{Y}_h$ is normally distributed.

**Example Calculation of $s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$ for $X_h = 4.5$ (an advertising spend of $450):**
* $s^2 = 0.10$, $n=5$, $\bar{X}=4$, $\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$.
* $s^2\{\hat{Y}_{4.5}\} = 0.10 \left[ \frac{1}{5} + \frac{(4.5 - 4)^2}{10} \right]$
    $s^2\{\hat{Y}_{4.5}\} = 0.10 \left[ 0.2 + \frac{(0.5)^2}{10} \right]$
    $s^2\{\hat{Y}_{4.5}\} = 0.10 \left[ 0.2 + \frac{0.25}{10} \right] = 0.10 \left[ 0.2 + 0.025 \right] = 0.10(0.225) = 0.0225$
* $s\{\hat{Y}_{4.5}\} = \sqrt{0.0225} = 0.15$

### Sampling Distribution of $(\hat{Y}_h - E\{Y_h\})/s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$

$t^* = \frac{\hat{Y}_h - E\{Y_h\}}{s\{\hat{Y}_h\}}$
This statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.

### Confidence Interval for $E\{Y_h\}$

The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ confidence interval for the mean response $E\{Y_h\}$ is:

$\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2) s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$

**Example Calculation of 95% Confidence Interval for $E\{Y_h\}$ when $X_h = 4.5$:**
* $\hat{Y}_{4.5} = 1.6 + 1.7(4.5) = 1.6 + 7.65 = 9.25$
* $s\{\hat{Y}_{4.5}\} = 0.15$
* $n-2 = 3$ degrees of freedom.
* $t(0.975; 3) = 3.182$.

$CI = 9.25 \pm 3.182 \times 0.15$
$CI = 9.25 \pm 0.4773$
Lower bound: $9.25 - 0.4773 = 8.7727$
Upper bound: $9.25 + 0.4773 = 9.7273$

The 95% confidence interval for the *mean* weekly sales when advertising spend is $450 is $[$8,772.7, $9,727.3].
**Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that the true mean weekly sales for all weeks with $450 advertising spend is between $8,772.7 and $9,727.3. Notice that the width of the interval is narrowest at $X_h = \bar{X}$ and widens as $X_h$ moves away from $\bar{X}$.

## 2.5 Prediction of New Observation (Page 55)

We often want to predict a *single new observation* $Y_{h(new)}$ for a given $X_h$. This is different from estimating the mean response $E\{Y_h\}$, as it involves predicting an individual value, which has an additional source of variability (the random error term itself).

### Prediction Interval for $Y_{h(new)}$ when Parameters Known (Conceptual)

If $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\sigma^2$ were known, the prediction interval for a new observation $Y_{h(new)}$ would be centered at $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_h$ and its width would depend only on $\sigma^2$. This is rarely the case in practice.

### Prediction Interval for $Y_{h(new)}$ when Parameters Unknown

Since parameters are unknown, the prediction interval for $Y_{h(new)}$ must account for two sources of uncertainty:
1.  The uncertainty in estimating the mean response $E\{Y_h\}$ (due to $b_0$ and $b_1$ being estimates).
2.  The inherent variability of a new observation around its mean (due to the error term $\epsilon_{h(new)}$).

The variance of the prediction of a new observation is:
$\text{Var}(Y_{h(new)} - \hat{Y}_h) = \sigma^2_{pred} = \sigma^2 + \sigma^2\{\hat{Y}_h\} = \sigma^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
The estimated variance for prediction is:
$s^2_{pred} = s^2 \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
The standard error of prediction is $s_{pred} = \sqrt{s^2_{pred}}$.

The $(1-\alpha)100\%$ prediction interval for a new observation $Y_{h(new)}$ is:

$\hat{Y}_h \pm t(1-\alpha/2; n-2) s_{pred}$

**Example Calculation of 95% Prediction Interval for $Y_{h(new)}$ when $X_h = 4.5$:**
* $\hat{Y}_{4.5} = 9.25$
* $s^2 = 0.10$, $n=5$, $\bar{X}=4$, $\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$.
* $s^2_{pred} = 0.10 \left[ 1 + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{(4.5 - 4)^2}{10} \right]$
    $s^2_{pred} = 0.10 \left[ 1 + 0.2 + \frac{0.25}{10} \right]$
    $s^2_{pred} = 0.10 \left[ 1 + 0.2 + 0.025 \right] = 0.10(1.225) = 0.1225$
* $s_{pred} = \sqrt{0.1225} = 0.35$
* $n-2 = 3$ degrees of freedom.
* $t(0.975; 3) = 3.182$.

$PI = 9.25 \pm 3.182 \times 0.35$
$PI = 9.25 \pm 1.1137$
Lower bound: $9.25 - 1.1137 = 8.1363$
Upper bound: $9.25 + 1.1137 = 10.3637$

The 95% prediction interval for a *new individual week's sales* with $450 advertising spend is $[$8,136.3, $10,363.7].
**Interpretation:** We are 95% confident that a single new week with $450 advertising spend will have sales between $8,136.3 and $10,363.7.
**Key Difference:** Notice that the prediction interval ($PI$) is wider than the confidence interval ($CI$) for $E\{Y_h\}$ because it accounts for the additional variability of a single observation.

### Prediction of Mean of $m$ New Observations for Given $X_h$ (Page 60)

If we want to predict the mean of $m$ new observations ($Y_{h(new, mean)}$) at a given $X_h$, the prediction interval will be narrower than for a single observation but wider than for $E\{Y_h\}$. The variance term $\sigma^2$ in $s^2_{pred}$ is divided by $m$.
$s^2_{pred(mean)} = s^2 \left[ \frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right]$
The interval formula remains similar. This accounts for the reduced variability when predicting a mean rather than a single value.

## 2.6 Confidence Band for Regression Line (Page 61)

A **confidence band** for the entire regression line provides a simultaneous confidence interval for the *mean response* $E\{Y_h\}$ for *all possible values of X* (or over a specified range of X values).

* Unlike a confidence interval for $E\{Y_h\}$ at a *single* $X_h$, which is calculated for a specific point, the confidence band guarantees that the entire true regression line will fall within the band with a specified confidence level.
* The confidence band is generally wider than the point-wise confidence intervals for $E\{Y_h\}$ at any specific $X_h$. This is because it must account for the uncertainty across the entire range of $X$.
* A common method for constructing a confidence band is the **Working-Hotelling confidence band**. The formula is more complex, involving an F-statistic instead of a t-statistic, reflecting that it's a simultaneous inference.

## 2.7 Analysis of Variance Approach to Regression Analysis (Page 63)

The **Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)** approach provides an alternative, but equivalent, way to perform hypothesis tests in regression, particularly for the overall significance of the regression model. It partitions the total variability in the dependent variable $Y$ into components attributable to the regression (explained by $X$) and to random error (unexplained).

### Partitioning of Total Sum of Squares

The fundamental identity in ANOVA for simple linear regression is:

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$

This can be written as:

**SST = SSR + SSE**

Where:
* **SST (Total Sum of Squares):** $\sum(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2$. Measures the total variation in the observed $Y$ values around their mean $\bar{Y}$.
* **SSR (Regression Sum of Squares):** $\sum(\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2$. Measures the variation in $Y$ values explained by the regression line (i.e., how much the fitted values $\hat{Y}_i$ vary around the mean $\bar{Y}$). This is the "explained" variation.
* **SSE (Error Sum of Squares):** $\sum(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$. Measures the variation in $Y$ values around the fitted regression line. This is the "unexplained" or "residual" variation.

**Example Calculation of SST, SSR:**
From our previous calculations:
* $SST = \sum (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 = 29.2$
* $SSE = 0.30$

Therefore, $SSR = SST - SSE = 29.2 - 0.30 = 28.9$

### Breakdown of Degrees of Freedom

Similar to sums of squares, degrees of freedom also partition:

**$df_{Total} = df_{Regression} + df_{Error}$**

* **$df_{Total}$ (Total Degrees of Freedom):** $n-1$. (For $n$ observations, $n-1$ deviations from $\bar{Y}$ are independent).
* **$df_{Regression}$ (Regression Degrees of Freedom):** 1 (for simple linear regression, as one independent variable).
* **$df_{Error}$ (Error Degrees of Freedom):** $n-2$. (For $n$ observations, having estimated 2 parameters, $b_0$ and $b_1$).

**Example:** $df_{Total} = 5-1 = 4$. $df_{Regression} = 1$. $df_{Error} = 5-2 = 3$.
Check: $4 = 1 + 3$. This holds.

### Mean Squares

Mean squares are calculated by dividing the sums of squares by their respective degrees of freedom:

* **MSR (Mean Square Regression):** $MSR = \frac{SSR}{df_{Regression}} = \frac{SSR}{1} = SSR$
* **MSE (Mean Square Error):** $MSE = \frac{SSE}{df_{Error}} = \frac{SSE}{n-2} = s^2$
    (Note: This is the same $s^2$ we calculated earlier as the point estimator of $\sigma^2$).

**Example Calculation:**
* $MSR = 28.9 / 1 = 28.9$
* $MSE = 0.30 / 3 = 0.10$

### Analysis of Variance Table

The ANOVA results are typically presented in a table format:

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F Statistic | P-value |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :---------------------- | :--------------- | :---------- | :------ |
| Regression          | SSR                 | 1                       | MSR              | $F^* = MSR/MSE$ |         |
| Error               | SSE                 | n-2                     | MSE              |             |         |
| Total               | SST                 | n-1                     |                  |             |         |

**Example ANOVA Table:**

| Source of Variation | Sum of Squares (SS) | Degrees of Freedom (df) | Mean Square (MS) | F Statistic | P-value |
| :------------------ | :------------------ | :---------------------- | :--------------- | :---------- | :------ |
| Regression          | 28.9                | 1                       | 28.9             | $28.9 / 0.10 = 289.0$ | <0.001 (approx) |
| Error               | 0.30                | 3                       | 0.10             |             |         |
| Total               | 29.2                | 4                       |                  |             |         |

### Expected Mean Squares

* $E\{MSE\} = \sigma^2$: The expected value of MSE is the true error variance $\sigma^2$. This is why MSE is an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$.
* $E\{MSR\} = \sigma^2 + \beta_1^2 \sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2$: The expected value of MSR is $\sigma^2$ plus a term related to the true slope $\beta_1$.
    * If $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ is true, then $E\{MSR\} = \sigma^2$.
    * If $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ is false, then $E\{MSR\} > \sigma^2$.

### F Test of $\beta_1 = 0$ versus $\beta_1 \neq 0$

The ANOVA F-test assesses the overall significance of the regression model. In simple linear regression, it is equivalent to the t-test for $\beta_1 = 0$.

* **Hypotheses:**
    * $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ (No linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$).
    * $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0$ (A linear relationship exists).
* **Test Statistic:**
    $F^* = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$
    Under $H_0$, this statistic follows an $F$-distribution with $1$ numerator degree of freedom and $n-2$ denominator degrees of freedom, i.e., $F(1, n-2)$.
* **Decision Rule (at significance level $\alpha$):**
    * If $F^* > F(1-\alpha; 1, n-2)$, reject $H_0$.
    * P-value approach: If p-value $\le \alpha$, reject $H_0$.

**Example F Test for $\beta_1 = 0$ (at $\alpha = 0.05$):**
* $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$
* $H_a: \beta_1 \neq 0$
* $F^* = 289.0$
* Degrees of freedom = $(1, 3)$.
* Critical value for $\alpha = 0.05$ is $F(0.95; 1, 3) = 10.13$.

Since $F^* = 289.0 > 10.13$, we reject the null hypothesis $H_0$.
**Conclusion:** There is strong statistical evidence that advertising spend has a significant linear effect on weekly sales. (This matches the t-test conclusion).

**Relationship to t-test:** For simple linear regression, the $F$-statistic from the ANOVA table for testing $\beta_1=0$ is the square of the $t$-statistic for the same test: $F^* = (t^*)^2$.
In our example: $(17.0)^2 = 289.0$. This holds true.

## 2.8 General Linear Test Approach (Page 72)

The General Linear Test (GLT) provides a flexible framework for testing a variety of hypotheses in regression, including the significance of a single predictor or a group of predictors. It compares the fit of a "full" model to a "reduced" model.

* **Full Model:** This is the regression model specified by the alternative hypothesis ($H_a$). It typically includes all predictors thought to be relevant.
    For testing $\beta_1=0$ in simple linear regression, the full model is:
    $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_i + \epsilon_i$
    Its sum of squared errors is $SSE_F = SSE = \sum(Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2$, with $df_F = n-2$.
* **Reduced Model:** This is the regression model specified by the null hypothesis ($H_0$). It's a constrained version of the full model.
    For testing $H_0: \beta_1=0$, the reduced model is:
    $Y_i = \beta_0 + \epsilon_i$ (This implies $Y_i = \beta_0 + \epsilon_i$, i.e., $Y$ is just its mean plus random error, with no dependence on $X$).
    Its sum of squared errors is $SSE_R = \sum(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 = SST$, with $df_R = n-1$. (Since the only parameter is $\beta_0$, its estimate is $\bar{Y}$, and the sum of squares is $SST$).

* **Test Statistic:**
    The $F$-test statistic for the general linear test is:
    $F^* = \frac{(SSE_R - SSE_F) / (df_R - df_F)}{SSE_F / df_F}$
    This statistic follows an $F$-distribution with $(df_R - df_F)$ numerator degrees of freedom and $df_F$ denominator degrees of freedom.

* **Summary for Simple Linear Regression ($H_0: \beta_1 = 0$):**
    * $SSE_R = SST$
    * $SSE_F = SSE$
    * $df_R - df_F = (n-1) - (n-2) = 1$
    * $df_F = n-2$
    Substituting these into the formula:
    $F^* = \frac{(SST - SSE) / 1}{SSE / (n-2)} = \frac{SSR}{MSE} = \frac{MSR}{MSE}$
    This confirms that the General Linear Test for $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ in simple linear regression is identical to the ANOVA F-test discussed previously.

## 2.9 Descriptive Measures of Linear Association between X and Y (Page 74)

These measures quantify the strength and direction of the linear relationship.

### Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)

* **Definition:** The coefficient of determination, $R^2$, measures the **proportion of the total variability in the dependent variable ($Y$) that is explained by the independent variable ($X$)** through the regression model.
* **Formula:**
    $R^2 = \frac{SSR}{SST} = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST}$
* **Range:** $0 \le R^2 \le 1$.
    * $R^2 = 1$: The model explains all the variability in $Y$. All data points lie perfectly on the regression line.
    * $R^2 = 0$: The model explains none of the variability in $Y$. The regression line is horizontal ($b_1 = 0$), and $\hat{Y}_i = \bar{Y}$.
* **Interpretation:** An $R^2$ of, say, 0.70 means that 70% of the variation in $Y$ is accounted for by the linear relationship with $X$.

**Example Calculation of $R^2$:**
From our example: $SSR = 28.9$, $SST = 29.2$.
$R^2 = \frac{28.9}{29.2} \approx 0.9897$

**Interpretation:** Approximately 98.97% of the total variation in weekly sales is explained by the linear relationship with advertising spend. This indicates a very strong linear relationship.

### Limitations of $R^2$

* $R^2$ does not indicate whether the regression model is appropriate (e.g., if a linear model is the right choice). High $R^2$ doesn't mean a good model if assumptions are violated.
* A high $R^2$ does not necessarily imply causality.
* Adding more independent variables to a model will *never* decrease $R^2$ (it will either increase or stay the same), even if the added variables are not truly related to $Y$. This can make $R^2$ misleading for comparing models with different numbers of predictors, leading to the use of **adjusted $R^2$** in multiple regression.

### Coefficient of Correlation ($r$)

* **Definition:** The coefficient of correlation, $r$, is a measure of the **strength and direction of the linear association** between two variables, $X$ and $Y$. It is the square root of the coefficient of determination, with the sign indicating the direction of the relationship.
* **Formula:**
    $r = \pm \sqrt{R^2}$ (The sign matches the sign of $b_1$)
    Alternatively, using covariance formula:
    $r = \frac{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sqrt{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 \sum(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2}}$
* **Range:** $-1 \le r \le 1$.
    * $r = 1$: Perfect positive linear relationship.
    * $r = -1$: Perfect negative linear relationship.
    * $r = 0$: No linear relationship (but could be a non-linear relationship).

**Example Calculation of $r$:**
From our example: $R^2 \approx 0.9897$, and $b_1 = 1.7$ (positive).
$r = +\sqrt{0.9897} \approx +0.9948$

Using the direct formula:
$\sum(X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y}) = 17$
$\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2 = 10$
$\sum(Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 = 29.2$
$r = \frac{17}{\sqrt{10 \times 29.2}} = \frac{17}{\sqrt{292}} = \frac{17}{17.088} \approx 0.9948$

**Interpretation:** There is a very strong positive linear correlation between advertising spend and weekly sales.

## 2.10 Considerations in Applying Regression Analysis (Page 77)

Applying regression analysis effectively requires careful consideration beyond just calculating numbers:
* **Appropriate Data:** Ensure data is relevant, accurate, and represents the population of interest.
* **Model Assumptions:** Always check the assumptions of the regression model (linearity, constant variance, normality of errors, independence of errors). Violations can invalidate results.
* **Extrapolation:** Be cautious when predicting for $X$ values outside the range of the observed data. The linear relationship might not hold.
* **Outliers and Influential Points:** Identify and investigate unusual observations that might disproportionately affect the regression line.
* **Multicollinearity (in Multiple Regression):** If independent variables are highly correlated with each other, it can cause problems in estimating individual effects. (More relevant for Chapter 6 onwards).
* **Causality:** Remember that regression establishes association, not necessarily causation.
* **Practical Significance vs. Statistical Significance:** A statistically significant result (e.g., $p < 0.05$) doesn't always mean the effect is practically important. Consider the magnitude of the slope, $R^2$, and the context.

---

## 2.11 Normal Correlation Models (Page 78)

This section distinguishes between two contexts where correlation and regression are used.

### Distinction between Regression and Correlation Model

* **Regression Model (X fixed, Y random):** In this context, the $X$ values are assumed to be fixed (chosen by the experimenter) or measured without error. The variability is entirely in $Y$ (via $\epsilon$). Inferences focus on how the mean of $Y$ changes with $X$. Our previous discussions on inference for $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $E\{Y_h\}$ fall under this framework.
* **Correlation Model (X and Y both random):** Here, both $X$ and $Y$ are considered random variables. Data is often obtained by observing pairs $(X_i, Y_i)$ from a random sample. This model is used when the primary interest is in understanding the strength and direction of the association between two random variables, rather than predicting one from the other with $X$ as a fixed predictor. The bivariate normal distribution is a common assumption in this context.

### Bivariate Normal Distribution (Page 78)

When both $X$ and $Y$ are random variables, they are often assumed to follow a **bivariate normal distribution**. Its key properties include:
* **Marginal Distributions are Normal:** If $(X, Y)$ are bivariate normal, then the marginal distribution of $X$ is normal, and the marginal distribution of $Y$ is normal.
* **Conditional Distributions are Normal:** The conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X=X_h$ is normal, and similarly for $X$ given $Y=Y_h$.
* **Linearity of Conditional Means:** The mean of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is a linear function of $X$: $E\{Y|X\} = \mu_Y + \rho \frac{\sigma_Y}{\sigma_X}(X - \mu_X)$. Similarly for $X$ given $Y$. This shows why linear regression is appropriate when data comes from a bivariate normal distribution.
* **Constant Conditional Variances:** The variance of the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is constant, $\sigma^2_{Y|X} = \sigma_Y^2(1 - \rho^2)$. This aligns with the homoscedasticity assumption in regression.
* **Parameters:** A bivariate normal distribution is fully characterized by 5 parameters: $\mu_X, \mu_Y, \sigma_X^2, \sigma_Y^2$, and the correlation coefficient $\rho$.

### Conditional Inferences (Page 80)

Even if $X$ is a random variable, inferences about the regression parameters (like $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$) and the conditional mean $E\{Y_h\}$ derived under the fixed $X$ model remain valid, provided:
* The conditional distributions of $Y$ given $X$ are normal.
* The conditional variances are constant.
* The observations are independent.

This is a crucial point: standard regression analysis techniques are quite robust to $X$ being random, as long as the conditional distribution assumptions hold.

### Inferences on Correlation Coefficients (Page 83)

When the primary interest is in the correlation $\rho$ between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ (assumed bivariate normal):

* **Test for $\rho = 0$:**
    * **Hypotheses:** $H_0: \rho = 0$ vs. $H_a: \rho \neq 0$.
    * **Test Statistic:** $t^* = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}$
    * This $t^*$ statistic follows a $t$-distribution with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.
    * **Crucial Link:** Testing $H_0: \rho = 0$ is exactly equivalent to testing $H_0: \beta_1 = 0$ in the regression of $Y$ on $X$ (or $X$ on $Y$). If one is zero, the other is zero. If $b_1 \neq 0$, then $r \neq 0$.

* **Confidence Interval for $\rho$ (Fisher's Z-transformation):**
    Since the sampling distribution of $r$ is skewed when $\rho \neq 0$, we use Fisher's $Z$-transformation to transform $r$ to a variable that is approximately normally distributed:
    $Z_r = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1+r}{1-r} \right)$
    $Z_r$ is approximately normal with mean $Z_\rho = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1+\rho}{1-\rho} \right)$ and variance $\sigma^2\{Z_r\} = \frac{1}{n-3}$.
    The confidence interval for $Z_\rho$ is:
    $Z_r \pm z(1-\alpha/2) \frac{1}{\sqrt{n-3}}$
    Once the interval for $Z_\rho$ is found, it is transformed back to get the confidence interval for $\rho$.

### Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (Page 87)

This is a **non-parametric** measure of association.
* It measures the strength and direction of the monotonic (not necessarily linear) relationship between two variables.
* It's used when the data are ordinal or when the assumption of normality or linearity is severely violated.
* It's calculated by ranking the $X$ and $Y$ values separately and then calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient on these ranks.

Let's break down the F-test, its relationship with the t-test, the Working-Hotelling confidence band, and then cover some tricky interview questions related to linear regression.

## F-test: Expansion, Distribution, and Why

The F-test is a statistical test that uses the F-distribution to determine if two variances are significantly different from each other. While it's broadly applicable for comparing variances (e.g., in comparing two population variances), its most common and crucial application in regression analysis is to assess the **overall significance of a linear regression model** or to compare the fit of two different linear models.

**Why F-test in Regression?**

In linear regression, particularly multiple linear regression, the F-test serves a vital purpose:

1.  **Overall Model Significance:** It tests the null hypothesis that *all* the regression coefficients (excluding the intercept) are simultaneously equal to zero.
    * $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = ... = \beta_p = 0$ (The model with no independent variables fits the data as well as your model.)
    * $H_1:$ At least one $\beta_j \neq 0$ (Your model fits the data better than the intercept-only model.)

    If you reject the null hypothesis, it means that at least one of your independent variables contributes significantly to explaining the variation in the dependent variable. This indicates that your model, as a whole, is statistically significant and provides a better fit than a model with no predictors.

2.  **Comparing Nested Models:** The F-test can also be used to compare two nested linear models (one model is a special case of the other, often by removing some predictors). This helps determine if the additional predictors in the more complex model significantly improve the fit.

**The F-Distribution**

The F-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that arises as the ratio of two independent chi-squared distributed random variables, each divided by their respective degrees of freedom.

* **Shape:** It is asymmetrical and skewed to the right, only taking positive values.
* **Parameters:** It is defined by two degrees of freedom:
    * **Numerator degrees of freedom ($df_1$):** This corresponds to the degrees of freedom associated with the "explained variance" or "model variance." In overall regression significance, it's typically the number of independent variables ($p$).
    * **Denominator degrees of freedom ($df_2$):** This corresponds to the degrees of freedom associated with the "unexplained variance" or "error variance" (residuals). In overall regression significance, it's typically $n - k - 1$ (where $n$ is sample size and $k$ is number of predictors plus intercept, or $n - p - 1$ where $p$ is number of independent variables).

**F-statistic Formula (for overall regression significance):**

$F = \frac{\text{Mean Square Model (MSM)}}{\text{Mean Square Error (MSE)}} = \frac{\text{SSM / DFM}}{\text{SSE / DFE}}$

Where:
* **SSM (Sum of Squares Model):** Represents the variation in the dependent variable explained by the regression model.
* **SSE (Sum of Squares Error):** Represents the unexplained variation (residuals) in the dependent variable.
* **DFM (Degrees of Freedom Model):** Number of independent variables.
* **DFE (Degrees of Freedom Error):** Sample size - number of parameters in the model (including intercept).

A larger F-statistic (and a small p-value) indicates that the variation explained by the model is significantly greater than the unexplained variation, leading to the rejection of the null hypothesis.

## F-test vs. t-test

Both the F-test and t-test are used for hypothesis testing in linear regression, but they address different questions:

* **t-test:**
    * **Purpose:** Tests the significance of **individual regression coefficients**.
    * **Hypothesis:** For a specific coefficient $\beta_j$:
        * $H_0: \beta_j = 0$
        * $H_1: \beta_j \neq 0$
    * **Distribution:** Student's t-distribution.
    * **Interpretation:** A significant t-test for a particular predictor indicates that *that specific predictor* has a statistically significant linear relationship with the dependent variable, holding other predictors constant.

* **F-test (Overall Regression Significance):**
    * **Purpose:** Tests the **overall significance of the entire regression model**.
    * **Hypothesis:** $H_0: \beta_1 = \beta_2 = ... = \beta_p = 0$ (all slope coefficients are zero).
    * **Distribution:** F-distribution.
    * **Interpretation:** A significant F-test indicates that *at least one* of the independent variables contributes significantly to the model. It doesn't tell you which one(s), just that the model as a whole is better than a null model.

**Relationship in Simple Linear Regression:**

In simple linear regression (where there's only one independent variable), the F-test for overall model significance and the t-test for the slope coefficient are directly related. Specifically, the F-statistic will be the square of the t-statistic for the slope coefficient, and their p-values will be identical. This is because, with only one predictor, testing if *all* slope coefficients are zero is equivalent to testing if *that single* slope coefficient is zero.

$F = t^2$

## Working-Hotelling Confidence Band

In linear regression, we often want to estimate the mean response of the dependent variable ($E[Y|X]$) for various values of the independent variable(s).

* **Confidence Interval for a Single Mean Response:** A standard confidence interval for the mean response at a *specific, single* value of X ($X_h$) provides a range within which we are confident the true mean response for that $X_h$ lies.

* **Working-Hotelling Confidence Band:** When we want to estimate the mean response for *multiple* or *all possible* values of X simultaneously, using individual confidence intervals for each point can lead to a significant increase in the overall (family-wise) error rate. The Working-Hotelling confidence band addresses this by providing a **simultaneous confidence band** for the entire regression line (or surface in multiple regression).

**Key Features and Interpretation:**

* **Simultaneous Coverage:** The Working-Hotelling confidence band ensures that, with a specified confidence level (e.g., 95%), the *entire* true regression line (or surface) will be contained within the band. This is a stronger statement than saying each individual confidence interval contains its true mean response.
* **Wider than Pointwise Confidence Intervals:** Because it accounts for the uncertainty across *all possible* predictions, the Working-Hotelling band will generally be wider than individual (pointwise) confidence intervals for the mean response at specific X values, especially at the extremes of the observed X range.
* **Hyperbolic Shape (Simple Linear Regression):** In simple linear regression, the Working-Hotelling confidence band typically has a hyperbolic shape, being narrowest at the mean of the independent variable ($\bar{X}$) and widening as you move away from $\bar{X}$. This reflects the increased uncertainty in predicting responses further from the center of the observed data.
* **Formula:** The general form of the Working-Hotelling confidence band for the mean response $E[Y_h]$ at a new observation $X_h$ is:

    $\hat{Y}_h \pm W \cdot s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$

    Where:
    * $\hat{Y}_h$ is the predicted mean response at $X_h$.
    * $s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$ is the standard error of the predicted mean response at $X_h$.
    * $W$ is a critical value based on the F-distribution. For simple linear regression, $W = \sqrt{2 F_{\alpha, 2, n-2}}$, where $F_{\alpha, 2, n-2}$ is the critical value from the F-distribution with 2 and $n-2$ degrees of freedom at a significance level of $\alpha$.

    The specific formula for $s\{\hat{Y}_h\}$ in simple linear regression is:

    $s\{\hat{Y}_h\} = \text{MSE} \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} + \frac{(X_h - \bar{X})^2}{\sum(X_i - \bar{X})^2}}$

**Working-Hotelling vs. Prediction Interval:**

It's crucial to distinguish the Working-Hotelling confidence band from a **prediction interval**.

* **Confidence Band (Working-Hotelling):** For the *mean response* $E[Y|X]$ for all values of X. It's about the true regression line.
* **Prediction Interval:** For a *single new observation* $Y_{new}$ at a specific X value. This interval is always wider than the confidence interval for the mean response because it accounts for both the uncertainty in the estimated mean response *and* the inherent variability of individual observations around that mean.

## Tricky Interview Questions on Linear Regression (based on "two chapters" - likely implying assumptions and interpretation)

Here are some tricky interview questions, focusing on common pitfalls and deeper understanding beyond just memorizing definitions:

**1. Assumptions:**

* **"You've built a linear regression model and it has a high R-squared. Does this automatically mean your model is good? What's the first thing you'd check to confirm its validity, and why?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** High R-squared can be misleading.
    * **Answer:** No, a high R-squared doesn't automatically mean the model is good. The first thing I'd check are the **assumptions of linear regression**, particularly the **residual plots**. A high R-squared might simply mean the model is overfitting or that the relationship is non-linear but the linear model still captures *some* variance. Residual plots (residuals vs. fitted values, normal Q-Q plot of residuals) help assess linearity, homoscedasticity, and normality of errors. If these assumptions are violated, the model's coefficients and p-values are unreliable, regardless of R-squared.

* **"Explain the assumption of homoscedasticity. What happens if it's violated (heteroscedasticity), and how would you detect and potentially address it?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** Understanding the consequences beyond just "it's an assumption."
    * **Answer:** Homoscedasticity assumes that the variance of the error terms (residuals) is constant across all levels of the independent variables. If violated (heteroscedasticity), the standard errors of the regression coefficients will be biased, leading to incorrect p-values and confidence intervals. This means your inferences about the significance of predictors will be unreliable.
        * **Detection:** **Residual plots** (residuals vs. fitted values or vs. independent variables) are the primary tool. A "fan" or "cone" shape indicates heteroscedasticity. Statistical tests like the Breusch-Pagan test or White test can also be used.
        * **Addressing:**
            * **Transforming the dependent variable:** e.g., log transformation (if the variance increases with the mean).
            * **Weighted Least Squares (WLS):** Giving less weight to observations with larger variances.
            * **Robust standard errors:** Calculating standard errors that are robust to heteroscedasticity (e.g., White's heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors).

* **"Multicollinearity is a common issue. How does it manifest, what are its impacts, and how do you decide whether to address it?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** Deciding when it's a "problem" and the trade-offs of solutions.
    * **Answer:** Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model are highly correlated with each other.
        * **Manifestation:**
            * Large standard errors for coefficients, leading to insignificant t-tests even if the overall F-test is significant.
            * Coefficient signs might be opposite of what's expected based on theory.
            * Small changes in the data can lead to large changes in coefficients.
        * **Impacts:** While it doesn't bias the overall model predictions, it makes it difficult to interpret the individual impact of correlated predictors. It inflates the variance of coefficient estimates.
        * **Decision to address:** It's a problem if you care about the individual interpretations of coefficients or if you need precise estimates of their effects. If the goal is purely prediction and the overall model performance is good, moderate multicollinearity might be acceptable.
        * **Addressing:**
            * **Feature selection:** Removing one of the highly correlated variables.
            * **Combine variables:** Creating an index or composite variable from the correlated ones.
            * **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Transforming correlated variables into uncorrelated components.
            * **Ridge or Lasso Regression:** Regularization techniques that can handle multicollinearity by shrinking coefficients.

**2. Interpretation & R-squared:**

* **"Your model has an R-squared of 0.15. Is this a 'bad' model? Justify your answer."**
    * **Tricky aspect:** R-squared is context-dependent; a low R-squared isn't always "bad."
    * **Answer:** Not necessarily. The "goodness" of an R-squared value is highly dependent on the field of study and the nature of the data. In fields dealing with human behavior (e.g., social sciences, psychology), R-squared values of 15-30% can be considered quite good because human behavior is inherently complex and influenced by many unmeasurable factors. In experimental sciences with tightly controlled conditions, you might expect much higher R-squared values. The key is whether the model captures a statistically significant and *practically meaningful* portion of the variance, and if the assumptions are met.

* **"You've run a regression, and the p-value for a specific coefficient is 0.001. Does this mean the effect of that variable is large and practically important?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** Distinguishing statistical significance from practical significance.
    * **Answer:** No, a small p-value (statistical significance) only tells you that the observed effect is unlikely to be due to random chance. It does *not* tell you anything about the magnitude or practical importance of the effect. A very small effect size can still be statistically significant with a large enough sample size. To assess practical importance, you need to look at the **coefficient's magnitude**, its **confidence interval**, and the **context of the problem**. For example, a coefficient of 0.001 might be statistically significant but practically meaningless if the units of the dependent variable are in thousands or millions.

**3. General Concepts:**

* **"When would you choose to use a simple linear regression over a multiple linear regression, and what are the trade-offs?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** Understanding model complexity and parsimony.
    * **Answer:** I'd choose simple linear regression when:
        * The theoretical relationship suggests only one independent variable is truly important.
        * I'm primarily interested in the effect of a single predictor and want to avoid the complexities of multiple predictors (e.g., multicollinearity, interaction terms).
        * I have limited data and adding more predictors could lead to overfitting.
        * The goal is to provide a very simple and easily interpretable model for stakeholders who might not have a statistical background.
    * **Trade-offs:** Simple linear regression is easier to interpret and less prone to overfitting with limited data. However, it often provides a less accurate and less complete picture of the relationships, as real-world phenomena are rarely explained by a single factor. Omitting relevant variables can lead to biased coefficient estimates for the included variable (omitted variable bias).

* **"How do you deal with outliers in your regression analysis? What are the potential consequences of not addressing them?"**
    * **Tricky aspect:** Understanding outlier types and appropriate responses.
    * **Answer:** Outliers are data points that deviate significantly from the general pattern of the data.
        * **Detection:** Residual plots, scatter plots, Cook's distance, leverage points, DFFITS, DFBETAS.
        * **Consequences of not addressing:** Outliers can disproportionately influence the regression line (especially if they are high-leverage points), leading to biased coefficient estimates, inflated standard errors, and a poor fit for the majority of the data. This can undermine the validity of your inferences.
        * **Dealing with them:**
            * **Investigate:** First, determine if the outlier is a data entry error or a genuine extreme observation. If it's an error, correct or remove it.
            * **Robust regression:** Use methods that are less sensitive to outliers (e.g., robust regression).
            * **Transformation:** Transform the variable (e.g., log transformation) to reduce the impact of extreme values.
            * **Remove (with caution):** Only remove genuine outliers if there's a strong theoretical justification (e.g., it represents a different population or a measurement error that cannot be corrected) and you report it.
            * **Keep and acknowledge:** Sometimes, the outlier is a valid and important data point. In such cases, keep it but acknowledge its presence and potential influence in your analysis.

These questions aim to probe not just your knowledge of definitions, but your ability to critically think about model assumptions, interpretation, and practical implications in various scenarios.
