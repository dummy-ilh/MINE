## 📘 MASTER NOTES: **Missing Data in Machine Learning**

---

### 🔹 1. DEFINITION

**Missing data** occurs when no value is stored for a feature in a dataset for a given observation.

---

### 🔹 2. TYPES OF MISSINGNESS (very important!)

| Type                                    | Definition                                                          | Example                                      | Assumption                         |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **MCAR** (Missing Completely at Random) | Missingness has **no relation** to any data, observed or unobserved | A sensor randomly fails                      | Data is unbiased, but info is lost |
| **MAR** (Missing at Random)             | Missingness depends **only on observed data**                       | Males skip weight entry, but gender is known | Can correct with modeling          |
| **MNAR** (Missing Not at Random)        | Missingness depends on **unobserved values**                        | People with high income don’t report income  | Cannot be ignored, must be modeled |

🧠 **Interview Tip**: Understanding this distinction is critical to justify your imputation method.

---

### 🔹 3. NOTATION AND FORMULATION

Let:

* $Y = \text{data matrix}$
* $Y_{obs} = \text{observed part}$
* $Y_{mis} = \text{missing part}$
* $R = \text{missingness indicator (1 if observed, 0 if missing)}$

**Goal**: Model $P(Y_{mis} | Y_{obs}, R)$

Under MAR:

$$
P(R | Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) = P(R | Y_{obs})
$$

---

### 🔹 4. IMPUTATION TECHNIQUES

| Method                             | Description                               | Pros                    | Cons                      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Mean/Median**                    | Fill missing with column mean or median   | Fast, easy              | Underestimates variance   |
| **Mode (categorical)**             | Use most frequent value                   | Simple                  | Ignores dependencies      |
| **KNN Imputation**                 | Use k-nearest rows to predict missing     | Accounts for similarity | Slow on large data        |
| **Multivariate Imputation (MICE)** | Models each feature as function of others | Captures correlation    | Slower, complex           |
| **Regression Imputation**          | Predict missing values using regression   | Better than mean        | Still biased              |
| **Deep Learning**                  | Autoencoders or GANs for imputation       | High-quality            | Needs more data, training |
| **Drop rows/columns**              | Remove incomplete rows or columns         | Safe if few missing     | Loss of data/information  |

🧪 Code example (mean imputation with pandas):

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
df['feature'] = df['feature'].fillna(df['feature'].mean())
```

---

### 🔹 5. VISUALIZATION TOOLS

Use these tools to explore missingness:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import missingno as msno

msno.matrix(df)
msno.heatmap(df)
```

---

### 🔹 6. ADVANCED STRATEGIES

#### 🔸 Indicator Variables:

Add a binary column indicating whether the original value was missing.

```python
df['feature_missing'] = df['feature'].isnull().astype(int)
```

#### 🔸 Multiple Imputation:

Generates multiple versions of the dataset with imputed values → models trained on all → results pooled.

---

## ✅ STATISTICAL & THEORETICAL QUESTIONS — IN-DEPTH ANSWERS

---

### ❓ **1. What assumptions must hold for listwise deletion to be unbiased?**

**Listwise deletion** (also called **complete case analysis**) removes any row with missing values.
It yields **unbiased parameter estimates only if data is MCAR**.

#### ✅ Assumptions:

* The probability of a missing value is **independent of both observed and unobserved data**.

$$
P(R = 1 | Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) = P(R = 1)
$$

* This ensures that the missing data is **a random subsample**, and the remaining data is still representative.

#### 🚫 Under MAR or MNAR:

* **MAR**: missingness depends on observed variables → deletion creates bias.
* **MNAR**: missingness depends on unobserved variables → serious bias and loss of information.

---

### ❓ **2. Why does mean imputation underestimate variance? Derive the impact.**

**Mean imputation** replaces missing values with the variable’s mean:

$$
x_i = \begin{cases}
x_i & \text{if observed} \\
\bar{x} & \text{if missing}
\end{cases}
$$

#### 🧠 Intuition:

* You're shrinking missing values toward the center.
* No variance is introduced by these imputed points, so the variance is **biased downward**.

#### 📉 Effect on variance:

Let $\sigma^2$ be the true variance. Suppose $m$ out of $n$ values are missing.

After mean imputation:

$$
\text{Var}_{\text{mean imp}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \leq \text{True Var}
$$

It **ignores the uncertainty** in the imputed values, leading to:

* **Underestimated variance**
* **Downward bias in standard errors**
* **Overconfident models**

---

### ❓ **3. What is the likelihood function under MAR vs MNAR?**

#### 📌 Let:

* $Y = (Y_{obs}, Y_{mis})$
* $R$ = missingness indicator matrix

---

#### Under **MAR**:

Missingness depends only on observed data:

$$
P(R | Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) = P(R | Y_{obs})
$$

The **observed-data likelihood** becomes:

$$
L(\theta) = \int P(Y_{obs}, Y_{mis} | \theta) dY_{mis}
$$

and the full likelihood:

$$
P(Y_{obs}, R | \theta, \phi) = P(R | Y_{obs}; \phi) \cdot \int P(Y_{obs}, Y_{mis} | \theta) dY_{mis}
$$

👉 We can **ignore the missingness mechanism** when estimating $\theta$ — called **ignorability**.

---

#### Under **MNAR**:

$$
P(R | Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}) \neq P(R | Y_{obs})
$$

Then:

$$
P(Y_{obs}, R | \theta, \phi) = \int P(Y_{obs}, Y_{mis} | \theta) P(R | Y_{obs}, Y_{mis}; \phi) dY_{mis}
$$

👉 Must **model the missingness mechanism** → requires **joint modeling** → very difficult!

---

### ❓ **4. How would you formally test whether data is MCAR vs MAR?**

#### ✅ 1. **Little’s MCAR Test**:

* Tests the null hypothesis: data is MCAR.
* Uses a chi-square statistic to compare means across patterns of missingness.

🧪 If p-value is small → reject MCAR → maybe MAR/MNAR.

Python:

```python
from statsmodels.imputation import mice
mice.MICEData(df).test_missing_pattern()
```

---

#### ✅ 2. **Logistic Regression on Missingness**:

* Create binary missingness indicators for each variable.
* Predict them using observed variables.

$$
P(R_i = 1 | X_{obs})
$$

📌 If prediction accuracy is **significant**, then missingness depends on observed variables → **MAR**.

---

### ❓ **5. What is Rubin’s Classification of Missing Data? How does it relate to identifiability?**

**Rubin (1976)** introduced a taxonomy:

| Type | Missingness depends on | Implication                      |
| ---- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| MCAR | Nothing (fully random) | Complete-case is unbiased        |
| MAR  | Observed values        | Imputation or weighting can work |
| MNAR | Unobserved values      | Must model missingness mechanism |

---

#### 🔁 **Ignorability**

If data is MAR and parameters governing missingness are **independent** of model parameters, then:

* Missingness is **ignorable**
* Likelihood can be maximized using observed data

---

## ✅ PRACTICAL ML QUESTIONS — IN-DEPTH ANSWERS

---

### ❓ 6. **You have 25% missing in a key feature — what do you do?**

**Step-by-step**:

1. Profile the data: missing heatmap (`missingno`)
2. Check correlation with missingness → MCAR/MAR/MNAR?
3. Does the variable impact model performance? (feature importance)
4. Choose:

   * If MCAR + small effect → drop
   * If MAR → impute using advanced techniques
   * If MNAR → possibly model missingness mechanism

💡 Consider: add missing indicator column to retain signal of missingness.

---

### ❓ 7. **How do tree-based models handle missing values?**

#### CART / Decision Trees:

* Use **surrogate splits**: if primary feature is missing, fallback to correlated split.

#### XGBoost:

* Assigns missing values to the **optimal direction** that minimizes loss.

#### LightGBM:

* Adds a **separate bin** for missing values.

📌 These models **learn from missingness** — unlike linear models.

---

### ❓ 8. **KNN imputation: how to choose k, and deal with scale?**

* Normalize features with `StandardScaler` before applying KNN.
* Tune `k` using cross-validation (use `GridSearchCV` with pipeline).
* Watch for:

  * Curse of dimensionality
  * Imputation bias when outliers dominate

```python
from sklearn.impute import KNNImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```

---

### ❓ 9. **Imputation done on train but not test data — what’s the risk?**

🚨 **Data Leakage**:

* If you impute on the full dataset, you **leak target statistics** (e.g., mean) from test → train
* Leads to **over-optimistic model performance**

✅ Solution: Use `Pipeline` to learn imputation **only from training data**, and apply to test set.

---

### ❓ 10. **Impute before or after train-test split? Why?**

* Always **split first**, then impute.
* Otherwise, you contaminate the validation/test set → invalid evaluation.

✅ Use:

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
```

---

## ✅ ADVANCED QUESTIONS — IN-DEPTH ANSWERS

---

### ❓ 11. **Using Variational Autoencoders (VAE) for imputation**

* Input: partially observed vector $x$
* Mask missing entries
* Encode into latent $z$, decode to reconstruct missing

Loss:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \text{Reconstruction Loss (only observed)} + \text{KL}(q(z|x) \| p(z))
$$

📌 Advantages:

* Nonlinear structure learning
* Works well on images, text, sensor data

---

### ❓ 12. **EM Algorithm for Gaussian Data with Missingness**

#### Goal:

Estimate mean $\mu$, covariance $\Sigma$ of Gaussian data $X$ with missing entries.

---

#### E-step:

Compute:

$$
\mathbb{E}[X_{mis} | X_{obs}, \mu^{(t)}, \Sigma^{(t)}]
$$

Use conditional expectation of multivariate Gaussian.

---

#### M-step:

Update $\mu$, $\Sigma$ using the completed data:

$$
\mu^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \hat{x}_i
$$

$$
\Sigma^{(t+1)} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i (\hat{x}_i - \mu)(\hat{x}_i - \mu)^T
$$

---

### ❓ 13. **How does MICE work and why is it better than single imputation?**

* Iteratively fills missing values **column by column** using regression models.
* Imputes each variable $X_j$ as a function of all others:

$$
X_j = f_j(X_{-j})
$$

* Cycles through each variable multiple times.
* Adds **sampling noise** → allows **multiple datasets** to reflect uncertainty.

📌 Better than:

* Mean (underestimates variance)
* Regression (biased)

---

### ❓ 14. **Income is MNAR — what do you do?**

* You **cannot ignore** or blindly impute.
* Consider:

  * **Heckman correction model**
  * **Bayesian modeling of missingness**
  * **Pattern mixture models**
  * **Sensitivity analysis** to assess robustness of assumptions

---

### ❓ 15. **Predictive Mean Matching (PMM) vs Regression Imputation**

| Aspect         | PMM                                       | Regression                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Mechanism      | Match predicted value to closest observed | Plug predicted value             |
| Distribution   | Preserves data distribution               | Smooths, underestimates variance |
| Outliers       | Safer                                     | Sensitive                        |
| Implementation | Slower                                    | Easier                           |

PMM is a hybrid → combines **predictive accuracy with realism**.

* Edge-case handling and **modeling philosophy**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL MISSING VALUE QUESTIONS TO TEST DEEP UNDERSTANDING

---

### 🔍 THEORY & STATISTICS

1. **What’s the consequence of using mean imputation on the distribution and correlation structure of your data?**
   → *(Think: loss of variance, distortion of relationships, underestimation of standard error, and impact on regression coefficients.)*

---

2. **How would you design an experiment to determine whether your data is MAR or MNAR?**
   → *(Trick: You can't empirically distinguish MAR from MNAR using the dataset alone. Must use domain knowledge or perform sensitivity analysis.)*

---

3. **You have 15% missing values in a feature. Should you impute, drop, or model it directly? What governs your choice?**
   → *(Depends on the missingness mechanism, predictive power, correlation with missingness, model type, business context.)*

---

4. **Why is multiple imputation preferred over single imputation? What statistical problem does it solve?**
   → *(Uncertainty quantification — multiple imputed datasets reflect variability of the imputation model → valid confidence intervals.)*

---

5. **If the missingness depends on the unobserved value itself (MNAR), what assumptions must be made for unbiased inference?**
   → *(You must model the missingness mechanism jointly with the data → ex. selection models like Heckman correction.)*

---

### 🔧 MACHINE LEARNING PRACTICE

6. **You build a model with mean imputation. It performs worse on live production data. Why might that be?**
   → *(Train-test mismatch due to different missingness patterns, ignored variance, misaligned marginal distributions.)*

---

7. **Why should you impute after the train-test split and not before?**
   → *(To prevent data leakage — test set statistics should not influence training data imputation.)*

---

8. **How do models like XGBoost or LightGBM leverage missing values as signal rather than a problem?**
   → *(They learn split directions for missing values or assign them to optimal bins — effectively using “missingness as a feature.”)*

---

9. **Is it ever useful to retain a missingness indicator variable even after imputation? Why or why not?**
   → *(Yes — especially in MAR or MNAR. The pattern of missingness can carry predictive signal.)*

---

10. **Suppose your dataset has MNAR values, but your model performs well in validation. Should you care?**
    → *(Yes — because the model may break in real-world scenarios where missingness pattern shifts. Your validation set may not reflect deployment conditions.)*

---

### 🧠 CONCEPTUAL JUDGMENT

11. **Is it better to drop rows or impute when <5% data is missing? Why or why not?**
    → *(Depends: if MCAR, drop might be okay; but imputation may retain valuable rows when data is limited. Also depends on sample size and importance of the feature.)*

---

12. **You’re given a clinical dataset where lab values are missing only for patients in better health. What does this imply, and what should you do?**
    → *(This is MNAR — missingness carries information. Ignoring it or using naive imputation will bias estimates. Consider joint modeling or missingness indicators.)*

---

13. **How would you explain the difference between MCAR and MAR to a non-technical stakeholder using a business example?**
    → *(Example: MCAR = survey lost in mail; MAR = older people more likely to skip tech questions — but you know age.)*

---

14. **If your imputation method is too aggressive, what’s the consequence on model performance and generalization?**
    → *(Overconfidence, underestimated uncertainty, optimistic validation metrics, poor robustness to distributional shift.)*

---

15. **How does missing data impact statistical inference differently than predictive modeling?**
    → *(Inference requires valid variance estimation → missing data affects standard errors and confidence intervals. Prediction can tolerate certain biases as long as accuracy holds.)*

---

Excellent — let’s tackle each point in-depth with **examples**, **intuition**, and **interview-ready answers**, so you deeply understand **missing data theory + application**.

---

## ✅ 1) **Examples of MCAR, MAR, and MNAR**

### 🔹 **MCAR – Missing Completely at Random**

**Definition:** The missingness is unrelated to any variable — observed or unobserved.

| Example                                         | Explanation                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Survey sheets lost in transit                   | Whether data is missing is purely random   |
| A sensor fails occasionally due to power outage | Not related to value or any other variable |
| Random database corruption                      | External failure, not data-dependent       |

✅ **Analysis remains unbiased**
❌ **Less common in real world**

---

### 🔹 **MAR – Missing At Random**

**Definition:** Missingness is related only to **observed variables**, not to the missing value itself.

| Example                                                     | Explanation                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Women tend to skip income question, but gender is known     | Missingness depends on gender (observed)     |
| Younger users skip retirement planning questions            | Age is known, so missingness is explainable  |
| Diabetics skip calorie intake, and diabetes status is known | Imputation can adjust using known predictors |

✅ Can use **regression/mice/knn** for imputation
🔍 **Testable via modeling**

---

### 🔹 **MNAR – Missing Not At Random**

**Definition:** Missingness is related to the **value that is missing** or some **unobserved variable**.

| Example                                               | Explanation                                |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| High-income people are less likely to disclose salary | Missingness depends on true (unseen) value |
| Patients with severe disease drop out of study        | Health status not observed → bias          |
| Depression survey: severely depressed skip the test   | Value itself causes the missingness        |

❌ **Untestable from data alone**
🔬 Requires **domain knowledge** or **modeling the missing mechanism**

---

## ✅ 2) **How Does Deletion Lead to Bias?**

Let’s say your dataset has income missing **only for high earners** (MNAR).

If you use **listwise deletion**, you are removing:

* A **non-random sample** of the data
* Biased toward lower incomes
* Mean income appears lower than reality

### 🔍 Why It’s Biased:

* Your model trains only on **observed** data
* But observed ≠ population due to **non-random missingness**

#### Example:

| Income (true) | Observed? |
| ------------- | --------- |
| ₹10,000       | ✅         |
| ₹1,00,000     | ❌         |
| ₹20,000       | ✅         |

→ Mean of observed = ₹15,000 → **severely biased**.

✅ If data is MCAR → deletion is unbiased
❌ If MAR/MNAR → deletion creates bias in estimates

---

## ✅ 3) **How to Test for Missingness Type**

### 🔹 Step-by-Step

#### 1. **Visual Tools**:

* `missingno.matrix(df)`
* `missingno.heatmap(df)`

---

#### 2. **Little’s MCAR Test**

* Tests whether missing data is MCAR
* Null hypothesis: data is MCAR

```python
from statsmodels.imputation import mice
mice_data = mice.MICEData(df)
mice_data.test_missing_pattern()
```

---

#### 3. **Logistic Regression on Missingness**

Create binary indicator of missingness and model it:

```python
df['feature_missing'] = df['feature'].isnull().astype(int)
model = LogisticRegression().fit(df[observed_cols], df['feature_missing'])
```

✅ If prediction accuracy is high → evidence of **MAR**

---

#### 4. **Domain Expertise**

* If missingness depends on the missing value → **MNAR** (not testable from data alone)
* Use **sensitivity analysis**

---

## ✅ 4) **How to Handle Missing Data — Q\&A Style**

| Question                                             | Suggested Answer                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| What are your first steps when you see missing data? | Visualize patterns, create missing indicators, check % missing        |
| When would you drop vs impute?                       | Drop if MCAR + small %, impute if MAR, model if MNAR                  |
| What’s the safest basic imputation?                  | Median for numeric, mode for categorical (less sensitive to outliers) |
| Best practice for imputation + modeling?             | Use pipeline with `SimpleImputer` or `KNNImputer` + model             |
| How to preserve signal of missingness?               | Add binary indicators (feature\_missing = 1 if missing)               |
| How to handle missing in time series?                | Use interpolation, forward/backward fill, or time-aware models        |

---

## ✅ 5) **How Do Tree-Based Models Handle Missing Values?**

### 🔍 Trees Handle Missingness Natively! That’s a huge plus.

#### 🎯 CART (Decision Trees):

* Uses **surrogate splits**
* If primary split feature is missing, uses backup feature with similar split

---

#### 🎯 XGBoost:

* Sends missing values to a **learned default direction** that minimizes loss

```python
xgboost.train(..., missing=np.nan)
```

---

#### 🎯 LightGBM:

* Adds a **“missing” bin** in histogram-based splitting
* Learns which side of the split missing values should go to

✅ Advantage: Trees **learn from missingness**

* If missingness correlates with target, they capture it
* No need for external imputation

## ✅ 6) **What Is Data Leakage? Why Is It a Problem?**

### ❗ Data leakage = when information from **outside the training data** is used to create the model.

### 🔥 Example of Leakage in Missing Data:

You impute missing values using the **mean of the entire dataset** (train + test) **before splitting**.

🔻 This means:

* You’re using info from test set to fill train set → **invalid model evaluation**

### 🔍 Leakage Can Occur When:

| Scenario                         | Why It’s Leakage                                              |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imputing before train-test split | Future info contaminates training                             |
| Scaling before split             | Same issue                                                    |
| Feature engineered using target  | "Target leakage" (e.g., using `loan_paid` to predict default) |

---

### ✅ Best Practices to Avoid Leakage:

* Always **split train/test first**
* Use **sklearn.Pipeline** to combine imputation + scaling + modeling
* Validate with **cross-validation**

```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('model', RandomForestClassifier())
])
```

## ✅ TL;DR Summary

| Topic         | Key Idea                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| MCAR          | Randomly missing → drop is OK                        |
| MAR           | Depends on observed vars → imputation safe           |
| MNAR          | Depends on unobserved/missing value → needs modeling |
| Deletion Bias | Deletes biased subsample if not MCAR                 |
| Trees         | Handle missing smartly (surrogate/default)           |
| Leakage       | Info from test influences train → invalid model      |
