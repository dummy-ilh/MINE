# Random variable

## 1. The Core Definition

Formally, a **random variable (X)** is a function that assigns a real number to each outcome in a sample space ().

* **Sample Space ():** The set of all possible outcomes (e.g., ).
* **Random Variable ():** The numerical value we care about (e.g., , ).

## 2. Discrete vs. Continuous

Random variables are classified based on the types of numbers they can take:

### Discrete Random Variables

These have "gaps" between their values. They are usually **counts**.

* **Definition:** Can take on a countable number of distinct values ().
* **Examples:**
* Number of students in a room.
* Number of heads in 10 coin flips.
* Number of cars passing through a toll booth.


* **Math Tool:** We use a **Probability Mass Function (PMF)** to find the probability of a specific value.

### Continuous Random Variables

These can take any value within a range. They are usually **measurements**.

* **Definition:** Can take an infinite number of values within an interval.
* **Examples:**
* The exact height of a person (e.g.,  cm).
* The time it takes for a battery to die.
* The temperature outside.


* **Math Tool:** We use a **Probability Density Function (PDF)** because the probability of an *exact* point (like exactly  degrees) is technically zero; we measure probabilities over intervals instead.

## 3. Why is it called "Random"?

It is called **random** because you don't know the specific value the variable will take until the experiment is performed. However, you *do* know the "distribution"—the pattern of how likely each value is.

| Concept | Algebraic Variable () | Random Variable () |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Value** | A specific fixed number (here, ). | Any value in a set (). |
| **Goal** | Solve for the unknown. | Describe the likelihood of outcomes. |

## 4. Key Properties

To fully describe a random variable, we look at:

1. **Expected Value ():** The "long-run average" or mean.
2. **Variance ():** How much the values typically spread out from the mean.
3. **Standard Deviation ():** The square root of variance, providing a measure of spread in the original units.
