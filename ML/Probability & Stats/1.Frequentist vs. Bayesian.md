## 🧩 Frequentist Approach (Objective)

### Core Idea

Probability represents **long-run frequencies** of outcomes from repeated, identical experiments.

So, under a frequentist view:

> “The probability of a fair coin landing heads is 0.5”
> means: *In infinite repeated tosses, 50% will be heads.*

### Parameters

In Frequentist statistics:

* Parameters like mean ( \mu ) or variance ( \sigma^2 ) are **fixed** (they exist in the real world).
* We can **estimate** them but not assign probabilities to them (since they’re not random).

### Example

Suppose we test a new drug and find that 60% of patients recover.

We might perform a **hypothesis test**:

* Null hypothesis: ( H_0: p = 0.5 )
* Alternative: ( H_1: p > 0.5 )

We then compute:
[
p\text{-value} = P(\text{data as extreme or more, given } H_0)
]
If ( p < 0.05 ), we reject ( H_0 ).

👉 Interpretation:

> “If the true recovery rate were 0.5, we would see results like this (or more extreme) less than 5% of the time.”

We **don’t** say “the probability that ( H_0 ) is true is 5%” — that’s not allowed in the frequentist world.

---

## 🧮 Bayesian Approach (Subjective)

### Core Idea

Probability quantifies **belief** about uncertain events, *given evidence*.

So, for Bayesians:

> “The probability that the coin is fair is 0.9”
> means: *I am 90% confident the coin is fair, based on my knowledge.*

### Parameters

Parameters are treated as **random variables** with prior distributions reflecting our beliefs before seeing data.

### Bayes’ Theorem

[
P(\theta \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid \theta) P(\theta)}{P(D)}
]

where:

* ( \theta ): parameter (e.g., true drug efficacy)
* ( D ): observed data
* ( P(\theta) ): prior (belief before seeing data)
* ( P(D \mid \theta) ): likelihood (probability of observing data given the parameter)
* ( P(\theta \mid D) ): posterior (updated belief after seeing data)

### Example

If you believe a new drug has a 50% chance of working before the trial (prior), and after seeing data that 60% of patients recover, you update your belief using Bayes’ theorem to get a posterior probability that might now say:

> “Given the data, there’s a 90% probability the drug works.”

---

## 🔁 Comparison Through Example

Let’s imagine a coin toss experiment.

### Scenario

We flip a coin 10 times and get 8 heads.

#### Frequentist:

* The coin’s bias ( p ) is fixed but unknown.
* We estimate ( \hat{p} = 0.8 ).
* We compute confidence intervals:
  “The 95% CI for ( p ) is [0.44, 0.97].”
* Interpretation:
  *If we repeated this entire experiment many times, 95% of such intervals would contain the true ( p ).*

#### Bayesian:

* Start with a **prior belief**, e.g., ( p \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1) ).
* Likelihood from binomial data: ( P(D|p) = \text{Binomial}(8; 10, p) ).
* Posterior: ( P(p|D) \propto p^8(1-p)^2 ).
* Interpretation:
  *Given our prior and the observed data, we are 95% confident that ( p ) lies in [0.56, 0.92].*

Note how the **interval** now reflects *degree of belief*, not long-run frequency.

## 🚀 Summary Statement

* **Frequentists**: “Probability is about long-run frequencies of data.”
* **Bayesians**: “Probability is about our belief in hypotheses given data.”

Both are powerful paradigms — **Frequentism** dominates classical statistics, while **Bayesian methods** are increasingly popular in modern ML and data science due to computational advances (e.g., MCMC, variational inference).

---
Perfect — let’s **do this by hand** so you see the math behind both the *Frequentist* and *Bayesian* interpretations step by step.

We’ll use the same simple experiment:
👉 You flip a coin **10 times** and get **8 heads**.

---

# 🧮 Given Data

[
n = 10, \quad k = 8
]
[
\hat{p} = \frac{k}{n} = \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
]
So, the **observed proportion (MLE)** is ( \hat{p} = 0.8 ).

---

## ⚖️ Frequentist Side

---

### (1) **Normal Approximation (Wald) 95% Confidence Interval**

Formula:
[
\hat{p} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1 - \hat{p})}{n}}
]

Given:

* ( \hat{p} = 0.8 )
* ( z_{0.025} = 1.96 )
* ( n = 10 )

Compute step-by-step:

1. Variance term:
   [
   \hat{p}(1 - \hat{p}) = 0.8 \times 0.2 = 0.16
   ]

2. Divide by ( n = 10 ):
   [
   \frac{0.16}{10} = 0.016
   ]

3. Square root → standard error:
   [
   \sqrt{0.016} = 0.1265
   ]

4. Multiply by ( z = 1.96 ):
   [
   1.96 \times 0.1265 = 0.2479
   ]

5. Interval:
   [
   0.8 \pm 0.2479 = [0.5521, 1.0479]
   ]

Since probability can’t exceed 1:
[
\boxed{\text{Wald 95% CI} = [0.55, 1.00]}
]

✅ **Interpretation (Frequentist)**:
If we repeated this 10-coin experiment infinitely many times, **95% of such confidence intervals would contain the true ( p )**.

---

### (2) **Exact (Clopper–Pearson) 95% Confidence Interval**

This uses **Beta distribution quantiles**:

[
\text{Lower bound} = \text{Beta}^{-1}\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}; k, n - k + 1\right)
]
[
\text{Upper bound} = \text{Beta}^{-1}\left(1 - \frac{\alpha}{2}; k + 1, n - k\right)
]

Here:

* ( \alpha = 0.05 )
* ( k = 8 )
* ( n - k = 2 )

So:
[
\text{Lower} = \text{Beta}^{-1}(0.025; 8, 3)
]
[
\text{Upper} = \text{Beta}^{-1}(0.975; 9, 2)
]

From Beta tables (or using approximate values):
[
\boxed{\text{Exact 95% CI} \approx [0.443, 0.974]}
]

✅ **Interpretation:**
If the true ( p ) were within this range, the observed outcome (8/10) wouldn’t be too surprising in 95% of repeated samples.

---

### (3) **Binomial Hypothesis Test**

**Null hypothesis:** ( H_0: p = 0.5 )
**Alternative:** ( H_1: p \neq 0.5 )

We calculate the probability of getting **8 or more heads**, or **2 or fewer heads** under ( H_0 ).

[
P(X \ge 8) = P(8) + P(9) + P(10)
]

Compute each term:

[
P(8) = \binom{10}{8} (0.5)^{10} = 45 \times \frac{1}{1024} = 0.0439
]
[
P(9) = 10 \times \frac{1}{1024} = 0.0098
]
[
P(10) = 1 \times \frac{1}{1024} = 0.0010
]

So:
[
P(X \ge 8) = 0.0439 + 0.0098 + 0.0010 = 0.0547
]
Symmetric, so ( P(X \le 2) = 0.0547 ).

Total two-sided ( p )-value:
[
p = 2 \times 0.0547 = 0.1094
]

✅ **Interpretation:**
Since ( p = 0.109 > 0.05 ), we **fail to reject ( H_0 )**.
The data are **not strong enough** to conclude the coin is biased.

---

## 📊 Bayesian Side

---

### (1) **Prior Distribution**

We use a **uniform prior**, i.e.
[
p \sim \text{Beta}(1, 1)
]

---

### (2) **Posterior Distribution**

The likelihood (binomial) and Beta prior combine nicely:

[
\text{Posterior: } p \mid \text{data} \sim \text{Beta}(a + k, b + n - k)
]
So:
[
a_{\text{post}} = 1 + 8 = 9, \quad b_{\text{post}} = 1 + 2 = 3
]

[
\boxed{p \mid D \sim \text{Beta}(9, 3)}
]

---

### (3) **Posterior Mean**

[
E[p \mid D] = \frac{a_{\text{post}}}{a_{\text{post}} + b_{\text{post}}}
= \frac{9}{9 + 3} = \frac{9}{12} = 0.75
]

### (4) **Posterior 95% Credible Interval**

From Beta(9,3) quantiles:

[
\text{95% CI} \approx [0.48, 0.92]
]

✅ **Interpretation (Bayesian):**
Given the data and prior, there is a **95% probability** that the true coin bias ( p ) lies in ([0.48, 0.92]).

## 🧩 Intuitive Summary

* **Frequentist:**
  “If we repeat the coin-toss experiment infinitely often, 95% of such confidence intervals would contain the true ( p ).”

* **Bayesian:**
  “Given what I believed before (uniform prior) and the observed data (8/10 heads), there’s a 95% chance that ( p ) is between 0.48 and 0.92.”
