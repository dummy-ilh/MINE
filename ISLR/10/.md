## 🧠 Unsupervised Learning: Challenges



---

### 🔍 Introduction

**Unsupervised learning** is a powerful branch of machine learning that **identifies patterns and structures** in data **without explicit labels**. Techniques such as **clustering**, **dimensionality reduction**, and **association mining** fall under this domain.

While these methods unlock insights from raw data, **unsupervised learning comes with unique challenges**—especially since there's no “correct” answer to learn from. As discussed in **Chapter 10 of ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R)**, understanding these complexities is crucial for making informed use of these techniques.

---

### 🚫 1. Absence of Ground Truth

#### 🧩 No Labels, No Feedback

* In supervised learning, model performance can be validated using known outputs.
* In unsupervised learning, **there are no true labels**, so we lack a direct way to measure success.

#### 🧪 Difficulty in Evaluation

* How do we know if a cluster is **good**?

  * Internal metrics like **silhouette score**, **WCSS (within-cluster sum of squares)**, or **gap statistic** are helpful heuristics, but not definitive.
  * Different metrics may suggest different solutions.

#### 🧠 Subjectivity of Interpretation

* The **meaning** of clusters is open to **domain-dependent interpretation**.
* Two analysts might draw different conclusions from the same results—**and neither can be definitively wrong**.

---

### ⚙️ 2. Sensitivity to Algorithms and Hyperparameters

#### 🎲 Initial Conditions Matter

* Algorithms like **K-means** depend heavily on **random initialization**.
* Different runs may yield different results (non-determinism).
* Solution: **Run multiple times** and choose the best outcome based on a selected metric.

#### ❓ Choosing the Number of Clusters (`K`)

* There is **no universal method** to determine the best number of clusters:

  * **Elbow method**
  * **Silhouette analysis**
  * **Gap statistic**
* All are helpful—but none are perfect.

#### 🎛️ Hyperparameter Tuning Is Harder

* Unsupervised models rely on parameters like:

  * `eps`, `min_samples` in **DBSCAN**
  * `linkage` in **hierarchical clustering**
* With no labels, **tuning these becomes exploratory** rather than guided.

---

### 📏 3. Curse of Dimensionality

#### 🕳️ Data Becomes Sparse

* As dimensions increase:

  * Data points become **increasingly distant** from each other.
  * Distance-based algorithms (e.g., K-means, hierarchical clustering) become less effective.

#### 🧮 Loss of Meaningful Distance

* In high dimensions, **Euclidean distance loses discriminative power**.
* All points may seem equidistant (Hughes phenomenon).

#### 💥 Higher Cost & Noise

* Computation becomes expensive (distance matrices, projections).
* Many features may be **irrelevant or redundant**, introducing **noise**.
* **Dimensionality reduction techniques** (like PCA) become essential to extract meaningful structure.

---

### 🔢 4. Handling Different Data Types

#### 💬 Numeric Bias

* Most algorithms assume **continuous numerical data**.
* Categorical data (like colors, countries) **can’t be used directly with Euclidean distance**.

#### 🔁 Complex Encoding

* Workarounds (e.g., one-hot encoding, Gower distance) exist, but:

  * May increase dimensionality
  * May lead to **loss of semantic structure**

---

### 🎯 5. Lack of a Standard Objective Function

#### ❓What Are We Optimizing?

* In supervised learning, you minimize a loss (e.g., MSE, cross-entropy).
* In unsupervised learning:

  * **Clustering** aims for “good” groupings—but “good” is vague.
  * **PCA** maximizes variance—but variance doesn’t always equal meaning.
  * **t-SNE/UMAP** focus on preserving local structure—but results can vary significantly.

#### 📈 Different Algorithms, Different Goals

* Different unsupervised methods may reveal **different structures** in the same data.
* No clear consensus on **which structure is correct**.

---

### 🧨 6. Noise, Outliers, and Interpretability

#### ⚠️ Sensitivity to Noise

* Distance-based methods can be **easily skewed by outliers**.
* **K-means** is especially vulnerable—single outlier can shift centroids.

#### 🧵 Interpretation Challenges

* Even if clusters/components are found, **interpreting them is often non-trivial**.
* **PCA** components may be **linear combinations** of variables that are **not easily explainable**.
* Clusters may not map clearly to business use cases or domain labels.

---

### 🧠 7. Algorithm Selection Dilemma

#### 🧭 Many Tools, No Clear Winner

* You can apply:

  * **K-means** for spherical clusters
  * **DBSCAN** for arbitrary shapes
  * **Hierarchical** for dendrograms
* But without a ground truth, it's difficult to **select the best algorithm**.

| Algorithm selection is unclear  | No definitive way to choose among K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical, etc. | Each finds different structures                 |


Absolutely! Let’s break down **dendrograms** in a clear, layered way — from intuition to formulas — so that you not only understand **what they are**, but also **how they work**, **how to build them**, and **how to interpret them**, especially in the context of **Hierarchical Clustering** as introduced in **ISLR Chapter 10**.

---

## 🌳 What is a Dendrogram?

A **dendrogram** is a **tree-like diagram** that **visually summarizes how a clustering algorithm groups data points together** at various stages.

### 🧠 Intuition:

* Imagine you start with **each point as its own cluster**.
* Then you **repeatedly merge** the two "closest" clusters.
* A **dendrogram shows this merging process** — from bottom (individual points) to top (one big cluster).

---

## 🔧 Dendrogram = Output of Hierarchical Clustering

There are two main types of **hierarchical clustering**:

| Type              | Description                                                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Agglomerative** | Bottom-up: start with individual points and merge clusters (most common) |
| **Divisive**      | Top-down: start with all points, then split (less common)                |

We focus on **Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering** since that’s what's used in ISLR.

---

## 🛠️ Steps to Build a Dendrogram

Let's say you have `n` data points.

### Step 1: Start with each point in its own cluster

> You now have `n` clusters.

---

### Step 2: Compute Distance Between All Clusters

* Initially, compute the **pairwise distance between all points** (Euclidean is most common).
* Store this in a **distance matrix**.

---

### Step 3: Merge the Closest Clusters

* Find the pair with the **smallest distance**, and **merge them**.
* You now have `n - 1` clusters.

---

### Step 4: Update the Distance Matrix

* After merging clusters A and B into a new cluster AB, **recompute the distances** between AB and the remaining clusters.

> This is where **linkage methods** come into play 👇

---

## 🔗 Linkage Criteria: How You Define Distance Between Clusters

| Linkage Type         | Distance Between Clusters                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single Linkage**   | Minimum distance between any pair of points (one in each cluster) |
| **Complete Linkage** | Maximum distance between any pair of points                       |
| **Average Linkage**  | Average of all pairwise distances                                 |
| **Centroid Linkage** | Distance between cluster centroids                                |
| **Ward’s Method**    | Increases in total within-cluster variance                        |

> Different linkage methods lead to **different dendrogram shapes**.

---

### Step 5: Repeat Until All Points Are Merged

Keep merging the closest clusters and updating the matrix until you have **a single cluster**.

---

### Step 6: Plot the Dendrogram

* X-axis = data points (or cluster labels)
* Y-axis = **height at which clusters were merged**, which represents **inter-cluster distance**

---

## 🖼️ Dendrogram Example

```
|           _______
|          |       |
|      ____|___    |
|     |        |   |
|  ___|___     |   |
| |       |    |   |
| A       B    C   D   E
```

* A and B were merged first (shortest distance)
* Then C joined AB
* Then D and E were merged
* Finally, (AB-C) and (D-E) merged at the top

---

## ✂️ How to Use a Dendrogram for Clustering

### 🎯 Goal: Decide how many clusters to use

#### Cut the dendrogram at a horizontal level:

* Draw a **horizontal line** across the dendrogram.
* Wherever the line **intersects branches**, count how many **vertical lines** it cuts = number of clusters.

> This is like slicing the tree horizontally at a height `h` to define clusters.

---

## 🧪 ISLR Example: NCI60 Cancer Cell Lines (Chapter 10)

In ISLR:

* They apply hierarchical clustering to gene expression data.
* The **dendrogram reveals groups of cell lines** with similar gene profiles.
* **Cutting the dendrogram** gives biologically meaningful clusters (e.g., leukemia vs. breast cancer).

## 🧠 Tip for Understanding

> Think of a dendrogram like a **family tree** of your data — showing how “related” different points are and at what point they “join the family.”

Great! You're asking for a **complete understanding of dendrograms and hierarchical clustering**, from **math to code to interviews**. Here's a **structured response** with all 4 requested parts:

---

# ✅ 1) Toy Example with Step-by-Step Dendrogram Construction

Let’s work with 4 simple 1D points:

```
A = 1  
B = 2  
C = 5  
D = 6
```

### 🔹 Step 1: Compute Pairwise Euclidean Distances

|     | A=1 | B=2 | C=5 | D=6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A=1 | 0   | 1   | 4   | 5   |
| B=2 |     | 0   | 3   | 4   |
| C=5 |     |     | 0   | 1   |
| D=6 |     |     |     | 0   |

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative, Single Linkage)

Let’s follow the agglomerative steps:

1️⃣ **Merge A and B** (distance = 1) → New cluster: AB

* Clusters: \[AB], \[C], \[D]

2️⃣ **Merge C and D** (distance = 1) → New cluster: CD

* Clusters: \[AB], \[CD]

3️⃣ **Merge AB and CD**

* Minimum distance between AB and CD = min(3, 4) = 3
* Final cluster: \[ABCD]

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Build Dendrogram

```text
Distance
   |
 5 +          
   |       _______
 4 +      |       |
   |      |       |
 3 +      |   ____|____
   |      |  |         |
 2 +      |  |         |
   |   ___|__|__     __|__
 1 +  |       |    |     |
   |  A       B    C     D
   +---------------------------> Points
```

# ✅ 2) Dendrogram Code from Scratch (No Libraries)

We’ll use **NumPy** only — not `scipy.cluster` or `sklearn`.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Step 1: Input points
points = np.array([[1], [2], [5], [6]])
labels = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

# Step 2: Compute distance matrix
from itertools import combinations

def euclidean(p1, p2):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((p1 - p2) ** 2))

n = len(points)
distances = {}
for i, j in combinations(range(n), 2):
    distances[frozenset([i, j])] = euclidean(points[i], points[j])

# Step 3: Agglomerative clustering using single linkage
clusters = [{i} for i in range(n)]
merge_history = []
merge_distances = []

while len(clusters) > 1:
    min_dist = float('inf')
    pair_to_merge = None

    for i, c1 in enumerate(clusters):
        for j, c2 in enumerate(clusters):
            if i < j:
                dists = [distances[frozenset([p, q])] for p in c1 for q in c2]
                d = min(dists)
                if d < min_dist:
                    min_dist = d
                    pair_to_merge = (i, j)

    i, j = pair_to_merge
    new_cluster = clusters[i].union(clusters[j])
    merge_history.append((clusters[i], clusters[j]))
    merge_distances.append(min_dist)

    # Update clusters
    clusters.pop(j)
    clusters.pop(i)
    clusters.append(new_cluster)

# Step 4: Manual plotting
def manual_dendrogram(merge_distances):
    plt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))
    plt.plot([1, 1, 3, 3], [0, 1, 1, 0], 'k-')  # A-B
    plt.plot([5, 5, 6, 6], [0, 1, 1, 0], 'k-')  # C-D
    plt.plot([2, 2, 5.5, 5.5], [1, 3, 3, 1], 'k-')  # AB-CD
    plt.xticks([1, 2, 5, 6], ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'])
    plt.ylabel('Distance')
    plt.title('Manual Dendrogram')
    plt.show()

# ✅ 3) Dendrogram Interview Q\&A (Conceptual)

### Q1: What is a dendrogram?

**A**: A dendrogram is a tree diagram showing the order and distance at which data points (or clusters) are merged in hierarchical clustering.

---

### Q2: How do you determine the number of clusters from a dendrogram?

**A**: By cutting the dendrogram **horizontally** at a specific height. The number of vertical lines intersected gives the number of clusters.

---

### Q3: What is the difference between single, complete, and average linkage?

| Linkage      | Definition                                      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Single**   | Min distance between points in the two clusters |
| **Complete** | Max distance between points                     |
| **Average**  | Mean of all pairwise distances                  |

---

### Q4: When would you prefer hierarchical clustering over K-means?

**A**: When:

* You don’t know the number of clusters in advance.
* You want a **nested structure**.
* You have **non-spherical** clusters.
* You need **dendrogram interpretability**.

---

### Q5: How does Ward’s method differ?

**A**: Ward’s method merges clusters to **minimize the increase in total within-cluster variance** (i.e., tries to preserve compactness).

---

### Q6: Disadvantages of hierarchical clustering?

* No automatic "best" number of clusters.
* Can be computationally expensive: $O(n^3)$ for naive implementations.
* Sensitive to outliers and noise.

---

# ✅ 4) `sklearn` Parameters and Defaults for Dendrograms

You’ll use `sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` + `scipy.cluster.hierarchy.dendrogram`:

### 📦 `sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering`

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
```

| Parameter            | Default     | Description                                                                         |
| -------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `n_clusters`         | 2           | Desired number of clusters after cutting the dendrogram                             |
| `affinity`           | 'euclidean' | Metric for distance (`manhattan`, `cosine`, etc.)                                   |
| `linkage`            | 'ward'      | Linkage method: `ward`, `complete`, `average`, `single`                             |
| `distance_threshold` | None        | Set this to use dendrogram height cutoff instead of `n_clusters`                    |
| `compute_full_tree`  | auto        | Whether to compute the full tree or stop early                                      |
| `compute_distances`  | False       | If True, returns distances between merged clusters (needed for plotting dendrogram) |

### 📦 Example Code to Plot with `scipy` Dendrogram

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import dendrogram
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

X = np.array([[1], [2], [5], [6]])

model = AgglomerativeClustering(
    n_clusters=None, 
    distance_threshold=0,
    compute_distances=True
)
model = model.fit(X)

# Generate linkage matrix for dendrogram
def create_linkage(model):
    counts = np.zeros(model.children_.shape[0])
    n_samples = len(model.labels_)
    for i, merge in enumerate(model.children_):
        count = 0
        for child_idx in merge:
            if child_idx < n_samples:
                count += 1  # leaf node
            else:
                count += counts[child_idx - n_samples]
        counts[i] = count

    linkage_matrix = np.column_stack([
        model.children_, 
        model.distances_,
        counts
    ]).astype(float)
    return linkage_matrix

linkage_matrix = create_linkage(model)

# 🧠 Final Tip for Mastery

> Dendrograms give a **visual explanation of how clusters form**, not just the end result. The ability to **cut at different levels** provides flexibility — but interpreting them well requires domain understanding and care with distance/linkage choices.
Let’s break it down in your requested order so that your **notes from ISLR (Introduction to Statistical Learning)** are **interview-ready**, **conceptually deep**, and **practically complete**.

---

## 🧠 1. **What is a Dendrogram?**

A **dendrogram** is a tree-like diagram used to illustrate the arrangement of clusters produced by **hierarchical clustering**.

Each merge is represented by a “U” shaped line that connects the two clusters being merged. The height of the "U" indicates the **distance** (dissimilarity) between the clusters.

---

## 🌳 2. What is **Hierarchical Clustering**?

Hierarchical Clustering builds a tree (hierarchy) of clusters.

There are two types:

* **Agglomerative (Bottom-Up)**:
  Each data point starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are merged as one moves up the hierarchy.
* **Divisive (Top-Down)**:
  All observations start in one cluster, and splits are performed recursively.

### ✅ Differences from K-means:

| Feature            | K-means          | Hierarchical       |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Type               | Flat             | Nested (Tree-like) |
| Need to specify k? | Yes              | No                 |
| Deterministic?     | No (random init) | Yes                |
| Reversible splits? | N/A              | No                 |

---

## 🔗 3. What are **Linkage Criteria**?

Linkage defines how the **distance between two clusters** is measured.

| Linkage Type | Description                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single**   | Distance between **closest** points                            |
| **Complete** | Distance between **farthest** points                           |
| **Average**  | Average distance between **all pairs**                         |
| **Ward**     | Minimizes variance within clusters (works with Euclidean only) |

## 🧸 4. Toy Example with Step-by-Step Dendrogram Construction

**Data:**

Let’s say we have 4 1D points:

```
A: 1
B: 2
C: 5
D: 8
```

### Step 1: Compute Distance Matrix

|   | A | B | C | D |
| - | - | - | - | - |
| A | 0 | 1 | 4 | 7 |
| B | 1 | 0 | 3 | 6 |
| C | 4 | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| D | 7 | 6 | 3 | 0 |

### Step 2: Merge closest pair: **A & B → AB**

Distance = 1

### Step 3: Update distances

* **Single Linkage**: min(dist(A,x), dist(B,x))
* AB–C = min(4,3) = 3
* AB–D = min(7,6) = 6

### Step 4: Merge next closest: **C & D → CD**

Distance = 3

### Step 5: Merge AB & CD

Distance = 6

**Dendrogram:**

```
    _________ AB
   |
   |    _____ CD
   |   |
___|___|___
   1   3   6
```

## 💡 6. Conceptual Interview Q\&A

### Q1: What’s the advantage of hierarchical over K-means?

**A:** No need to predefine `k`, and the hierarchy gives rich information at multiple granularities.

---

### Q2: Can hierarchical clustering handle non-Euclidean distances?

**A:** Yes. You can use custom distance metrics, especially in scipy’s `linkage()`.

---

### Q3: When would you prefer Ward linkage?

**A:** When you want compact, spherical clusters (similar to K-means behavior).

---

### Q4: What’s the downside of hierarchical clustering?

**A:** High time & space complexity: O(n²), not scalable for large datasets.

---

### Q5: Why is hierarchical clustering deterministic but K-means isn’t?

**A:** No random initialization. Every merge is based strictly on distance rules.

## ⚙️ 7. `sklearn` Hierarchical Clustering Parameters (AgglomerativeClustering)

```python
from sklearn.cluster import AgglomerativeClustering

model = AgglomerativeClustering(
    n_clusters=2,
    affinity='euclidean',     # or 'manhattan', 'cosine'
    linkage='ward'            # or 'complete', 'average', 'single'
)
model.fit(X)
```

### Parameters:

| Param               | Meaning                    | Default     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------- |
| `n_clusters`        | Desired number of clusters | 2           |
| `affinity`          | Metric for distance        | 'euclidean' |
| `linkage`           | Merge strategy             | 'ward'      |
| `compute_full_tree` | Whether to build full tree | 'auto'      |

> Note: `ward` linkage only works with Euclidean distance.

## 📌 8. Interpretation of Dendrogram

* **Height** of merge = dissimilarity
* **Closer nodes** merge first
* You can **cut** the dendrogram at a certain height to define **k clusters**

Example:
Cutting the dendrogram at `distance=4` → 2 clusters

Here's a full tutorial-style breakdown for **validating clusters** in **hierarchical clustering** (with dendrograms) and **other important considerations**. You can include this directly in your ISLR notes.

---

## 🧪 Cluster Validation in Hierarchical Clustering

Validation in unsupervised learning is tricky because there are **no labels**. So, how do you know your clusters make sense?

### 1. **Internal Validation Metrics**

These rely **only on the data and cluster assignments**:

#### a. **Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CCC)**

* Measures how faithfully the dendrogram preserves the pairwise distances between the original data points.
* **High CCC (close to 1)** → dendrogram is a good fit.
* Computed as correlation between original pairwise distances and cophenetic distances from the dendrogram.

```python
from scipy.cluster.hierarchy import cophenet
from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist

c, _ = cophenet(linkage_matrix, pdist(X))
print("Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient:", c)
```

---

#### b. **Silhouette Score**

* Measures **how similar a point is to its own cluster (cohesion)** compared to other clusters (separation).
* Ranges from -1 to +1:

  * **+1**: well clustered
  * **0**: overlapping clusters
  * **–1**: misclassified

```python
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_score

sil_score = silhouette_score(X, cluster_labels)
print("Silhouette Score:", sil_score)
```

> For **agglomerative clustering**, you must predefine number of clusters (e.g., `n_clusters=3`) before computing silhouette.

---

#### c. **Dunn Index, Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI)**

* Less common in practice but useful for academic interviews.

| Metric     | Goal     | Interpretation            |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------- |
| Dunn Index | Maximize | Higher = better separated |
| DBI        | Minimize | Lower = better clustering |

---

### 2. **Visual Validation Methods**

#### a. **Dendrogram Analysis**

* Inspect where large vertical jumps happen → good cut point for clustering.
* Rule of thumb: **cut at the largest vertical line that doesn't cross other lines**.

#### b. **2D Plotting**

* Use PCA or t-SNE to reduce to 2D and plot clusters with color coding.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_reduced = pca.fit_transform(X)
plt.scatter(X_reduced[:, 0], X_reduced[:, 1], c=cluster_labels)
```

---

### 3. **Stability-Based Validation**

Repeat clustering with:

* Different samples (bootstrapping)
* Noise added
* Subsets of features

Check how stable clusters remain:

* **Adjusted Rand Index**
* **Variation of Information**

---

## 🧱 Other Considerations in Hierarchical Clustering

### A. **Choice of Linkage Method**

| Linkage  | Description                            | Effect                                    |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Single   | Minimum distance between clusters      | Sensitive to noise, chaining effect       |
| Complete | Max distance                           | Tight clusters, but sensitive to outliers |
| Average  | Mean distance                          | Balanced                                  |
| Ward     | Minimize total within-cluster variance | Most common in practice                   |

✅ *Ward linkage often gives the most meaningful clusters for numeric data.*

---

### B. **Scaling of Features**

* **Important!** Hierarchical clustering is distance-based.
* Always **standardize features** (e.g., `StandardScaler`) unless all features are on same scale.

---

### C. **Computational Cost**

* Agglomerative clustering is **O(n²)** time and space.
* Not scalable for very large datasets (>10,000 rows).

👉 For large data, use:

* **Mini-batch KMeans**
* **BIRCH**
* **AgglomerativeClustering with connectivity constraints**

---

### D. **No Objective Function**

* Unlike k-means, there's no objective function being minimized.
* Dendrogram gives **flexible number of clusters**, but there's **no built-in “best” number** → subjective decision.

---

### E. **No Reassignment**

* Once a data point is assigned, **it can’t move to another cluster**.
* Early wrong decisions can’t be corrected.

---

| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How do you validate clustering without labels?                           | Internal metrics (silhouette, CCC), visual analysis                                            |
| Why is Ward linkage preferred?                                           | Minimizes within-cluster variance, balanced results                                            |
| What’s the difference between dendrogram height and cophenetic distance? | Height = distance at which clusters merge; cophenetic = distance between merged cluster points |
| Can hierarchical clustering be used on non-Euclidean distances?          | Yes, as long as the distance matrix is provided                                                |

Let’s go through the **interpretation of PCA**, covering:

1. **What PCA does**
2. **Scaling (why and when)**
3. **Uniqueness of PCA**
4. **Proportion of variance**
5. **How to interpret components**

---

### ✅ 1. What PCA Does (In Simple Terms)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a **dimensionality reduction technique** that:

* Transforms correlated variables into **uncorrelated axes** (principal components).
* Orders these axes such that the **first few explain most of the variance** in the data.
* Allows visualization and analysis in **lower dimensions** without losing much information.

📌 Think of it as rotating the coordinate system to align with the direction of greatest variability.

---

### ✅ 2. Why Scaling is Important in PCA

#### 🔸 If variables are on different scales (e.g., age in years, income in ₹ lakhs):

* The variable with **larger scale** dominates the principal components.
* PCA will **bias toward high-magnitude features**.

#### 🔸 Solution:

* **Standardize** the data before PCA (zero mean, unit variance).

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X_scaled = StandardScaler().fit_transform(X)
```

---

### ✅ 3. Uniqueness of PCA

* PCA solution is **not unique in sign** — multiplying a principal component by -1 gives the same variance.
* PCA **direction vectors (loadings)** are unique **up to sign**.
* But the **subspace** spanned by the top `k` components is unique.

---

### ✅ 4. Proportion of Variance Explained

* For each principal component:

  $$
  \text{Proportion of Variance Explained} = \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum_{j=1}^{p} \lambda_j}
  $$

  where $\lambda_i$ is the eigenvalue (variance explained) by PC\_i.

* The **cumulative variance** tells how many PCs are needed to retain, say, 95% of variance.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA()
pca.fit(X_scaled)

pca.explained_variance_ratio_   # Proportion for each PC
pca.explained_variance_ratio_.cumsum()  # Cumulative
```

📊 Rule of thumb: retain components until cumulative variance ≥ 90–95%.

---

### ✅ 5. Interpreting Principal Components

Each PC is a **linear combination** of original variables:

$$
\text{PC}_1 = a_{11}X_1 + a_{12}X_2 + \dots + a_{1p}X_p
$$

* Coefficients $a_{ij}$ are **loadings**.
* Larger magnitude → more influence.
* Positive/negative → direction of relationship.

#### Example:

| Variable | PC1 loading |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Age      | 0.7         |
| Income   | 0.6         |
| Spending | -0.4        |

⇒ PC1 increases with Age and Income, decreases with Spending.

Would you like me to:

* Walk you through a **toy PCA example with full calculation**?
* Show **PCA implementation with interpretation in code**?
* Create **interview Q\&A on PCA** next?

Let me know how deep you want to go.
Here’s a clean, beginner-friendly explanation of **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** without odd metaphors, but still using the right technical terms:

---

## 🌟 What is PCA?

**Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** is a **dimensionality reduction** technique used in machine learning and statistics.

It transforms a dataset with possibly many correlated variables into a smaller number of **uncorrelated variables**, called **principal components**, while **retaining as much variance (information)** as possible.

---

## 💡 Why PCA?

* Datasets often have **redundant features** (e.g., features that are correlated).
* High-dimensional data makes **visualization, computation, and modeling** harder.
* PCA helps:

  * Compress data (with minimal info loss)
  * Speed up training
  * Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D

---

## ⚙️ How PCA works (step-by-step):

Let’s say we have a dataset with variables $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$

### 1. **Standardization** (Scaling)

* PCA is sensitive to variable scales.
* We **center and scale** data so that each feature has **mean 0 and variance 1**.

### 2. **Covariance Matrix**

* Measures **how variables vary together**.
* If features are correlated, PCA finds new uncorrelated axes.

### 3. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

* Compute **eigenvectors (directions)** and **eigenvalues (importance)** of the covariance matrix.
* Each **eigenvector** is a principal component (PC).
* Each **eigenvalue** tells us how much variance is explained by that PC.

### 4. **Sort by variance**

* We sort principal components by their eigenvalues (descending).
* First PC = most variance
* Second PC = next most variance (and orthogonal to first), and so on.

### 5. **Project data**

* We **project original data** onto the top $k$ principal components (e.g., top 2 for visualization).

## 📈 Interpretation of PCA Output

| Term                    | Meaning                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Principal Component** | A new axis formed by combining original variables            |
| **Explained Variance**  | How much "information" each component captures               |
| **Scree Plot**          | A plot of eigenvalues – helps decide how many PCs to keep    |
| **Loadings**            | Coefficients showing how original features contribute to PCs |

---

## 📌 Important Concepts

### ✅ Scaling is a must

* Because PCA is based on variances, all features should be on the **same scale** (use StandardScaler).

### ✅ PCA is unique up to sign

* Principal components can flip signs, but interpretation remains the same.

### ✅ Total variance is preserved

* PCA does **not create new information**, it just redistributes it.

### ✅ PCA is unsupervised

* It ignores class labels (if any); purely looks at feature variance.

---

## 🧪 A quick example:

Say you have two features:

* Height (cm)
* Weight (kg)

These may be correlated. PCA finds:

* PC1: the direction with max variation (maybe a combo of height + weight)
* PC2: direction orthogonal to PC1 (captures leftover variation)

* Scree plot / visualization
* How to decide number of PCs
* Relation to SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
* Interview questions on PCA

Would you like to go deeper?
Let's break PCA (Principal Component Analysis) **step-by-step**, clearly and simply, without using odd analogies.

---

## 📌 What is PCA?

**PCA** is a technique to:

* Reduce the number of variables (dimensionality)
* While preserving as much **variance (information)** as possible.

It does this by creating **new variables** called **Principal Components (PCs)** that are combinations of the original variables.

---

## 🔄 Step-by-Step What Happens in PCA:

### ✅ Step 1: Standardize the Data (Scaling)

* Each variable (column) is transformed to have:

  * Mean = 0
  * Standard Deviation = 1
* This ensures all features contribute equally, especially important if they are in different units.

> Example: If your data has height (in cm) and income (in ₹), you must scale to prevent income from dominating.

### ✅ Step 2: Compute Covariance Matrix

* A square matrix that shows how variables **co-vary** with each other.
* Size: `n_features × n_features`

> This tells us which variables are correlated and by how much.

### ✅ Step 3: Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

* From the covariance matrix:

  * **Eigenvectors** → directions of new axes (principal components)
  * **Eigenvalues** → how much variance each PC captures

### ✅ Step 4: Sort and Select Principal Components

* PCs are sorted by decreasing **eigenvalue** (variance explained)
* You can decide to keep:

  * Top `k` PCs that explain a desired % of total variance
  * Or keep enough to explain 95%, for example

### ✅ Step 5: Project Data onto Principal Components

* The original data is **transformed** into a lower-dimensional space using selected PCs.

---

## 📌 What is a Principal Component (PC)?

A **PC** is:

* A **direction** in the original feature space.
* A **linear combination** of the original features.
* Orthogonal (uncorrelated) to other PCs.

Each subsequent PC:

* Captures the **maximum remaining variance**
* Is **orthogonal** to previous PCs

---

## 🎯 How Many Components to Select?

Use any of the following:

### 1. **Explained Variance Ratio (EVR)**

* Keep components that together explain \~95% of the variance.
* Plot a **Scree Plot** to visualize.

### 2. **Elbow Rule**

* Plot EVR vs Number of PCs
* Pick the point where the curve bends (elbow)

### 3. **Kaiser Rule**

* Keep only PCs with eigenvalue > 1

---

## 📈 Interpretation of Outputs

* **PC1, PC2** = First and second principal components.
* **Loadings** = Coefficients for each variable in a PC (show how each feature contributes)
* **Scores** = Transformed values (your new dataset in reduced dimension)

Let me know what to cover next.
Let's dive into **ISLR 10.2.2: Another Interpretation of Principal Components**, and then break it down **clearly for your notes**, especially from a fresher’s viewpoint.

---

### ✅ **What are Principal Components? (Recap in Simple Terms)**

* Imagine you have data with many **variables (features)**.
* Some of them are **correlated** (carry overlapping info).
* PCA finds **new axes** (directions), called **principal components (PCs)**:

  * Each PC is a **linear combination** of the original variables.
  * PCs are **uncorrelated** with each other.
  * PCs are **ordered** so that PC1 captures **most variance**, PC2 next, and so on.

---

## 🔍 Section 10.2.2: **Another Interpretation of Principal Components**

This section provides a **geometric and projection-based** way to understand PCs.

---

### 🪞 1. **Principal Components as Projection Directions**

* PCA seeks **directions** (lines/axes) in the feature space that **best represent the data**.
* PC1 = direction (vector) **along which the projections of the data points have the largest variance**.

  * You're "looking" at the data from different directions.
  * From each direction, you're checking: “How spread out is the data?”
  * PC1 is the direction where this spread is **maximized**.
* PC2 is **orthogonal** (perpendicular) to PC1 and captures the **next highest spread**.

---

### 🔢 2. **Mathematical View**

* Let’s say:

  * You have standardized data $X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times p}$
  * PCA finds **unit vectors** $\phi_1, \phi_2, \dots$ (each $\phi \in \mathbb{R}^p$)
  * PC scores: $z_{i1} = x_i^T \phi_1$ → projection of point $x_i$ on direction $\phi_1$

#### Objective of PC1:

Find $\phi_1$ that **maximizes variance** of $z_{i1} = x_i^T \phi_1$, subject to $\|\phi_1\| = 1$

---

### 📐 3. **Geometric View**

* Think of a **cloud of data points** in multi-dimensional space.
* PC1 is the direction that fits a **line** through that cloud so that the projected points onto this line are **most spread out**.
* It's like drawing the **best-fit line**, not to predict anything, but to **explain variance**.

---

### 📦 4. **Why Are PCs Useful?**

* **Dimension Reduction**: Keep top k PCs (say PC1 and PC2) instead of 100s of original features.
* **Compression**: Store fewer features but keep most info.
* **Noise Reduction**: Later PCs often capture **noise**, not signal.
* **Visualization**: Can plot data in 2D using PC1 and PC2.

---

### 📈 5. **How Many PCs to Select?**

* Use **Scree Plot**: Plot variance explained vs. PC number.
* **Cumulative Proportion of Variance Explained (CPVE)**: Choose enough PCs to reach a threshold (e.g., 90%).

---

---

Would you like a **toy numeric example** or **code from scratch** to understand this geometrically too?
Great — you're diving into **PCA** (Principal Component Analysis), and terms like **eigenvectors**, **eigenvalues**, and **orthogonality** are at the heart of it. Let’s break them down clearly and intuitively — without fluff — especially in the context of PCA, and tie it back to ISLR Section 10.2.2.

---

## ✅ What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues in PCA?

### 🔹 Eigenvectors:

* They are **directions** in the original feature space.
* In PCA, eigenvectors define the **Principal Components (PCs)** — new axes along which the data has the most variation.
* Each eigenvector is a **line** (or vector) that points in the direction where data spreads the most.

> So, **Principal Component 1** is the eigenvector pointing in the direction of **maximum variance**.

---

### 🔹 Eigenvalues:

* For each eigenvector, its eigenvalue tells **how much variance** the data has **in that direction**.
* So, higher eigenvalue = more important that direction is.

---

## ✅ Why Orthogonal (Perpendicular)?

* Principal Components (the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix) are **mutually orthogonal**, i.e., **at 90° to each other**.
* Why?

  * To ensure **no correlation** between the components.
  * Orthogonality = uncorrelated = independent axes = no redundant information.

---

## ✅ Another Interpretation from ISLR 10.2.2

ISLR 10.2.2 gives a **geometric viewpoint**:

* The **first PC** is the line (1D) that best approximates the data in terms of **least squared projection error**.
* The **second PC** is the best 1D line **orthogonal to the first**.
* PCA = finding **successive best-fit lines** in lower dimensions, always orthogonal to the previous.

So, the **first PC** captures the most structure (variance), then the next PC explains the **leftover structure**, and so on.

---

## ✅ Summary Table:

| Term           | Meaning in PCA                                                 |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Eigenvector    | A new axis (PC direction) with max variance                    |
| Eigenvalue     | Amount of variance along the eigenvector                       |
| Orthogonal PCs | PCs are at 90°, meaning no overlap in info (uncorrelated axes) |
| First PC       | Direction with **maximum variance** in data                    |
| Second PC      | Orthogonal direction with **next highest variance**            |

---

## ✅ How Many PCs to Choose?

1. **Scree plot**: Plot eigenvalues. Look for "elbow" point.
2. **Cumulative Variance**: Pick top k PCs that explain **\~90%+ variance**.
3. **Business or domain needs**: Sometimes even 2–3 PCs are enough for visual insights.

If you want, I can now:

* Show exact code with eigenvectors/eigenvalues
* Plot cumulative explained variance

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a fundamental technique in dimensionality reduction. It's not just about shrinking your data; it's about reorienting it to find the most informative directions, or "principal components," that capture the greatest amount of variance. The goal is to move from a coordinate system based on your original features (e.g., height, weight) to a new, more meaningful coordinate system. Let's walk through the steps, focusing on the intuition behind each one.

### Step 1: Standardize the Data

**What is happening:** For each feature (column) in your dataset, you calculate its mean and standard deviation. Then, for every data point, you subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. This process is often called "Z-score normalization."

**What it means:** Imagine you have a dataset of people with features like "age" (e.g., 20 to 80 years) and "salary" (e.g., $30,000 to $200,000). The salary values are much larger than the age values. If you didn't standardize, the salary feature would have a much larger variance and would dominate the PCA process, making the "age" feature appear insignificant.

Standardization ensures that all features have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This puts every feature on an equal footing, so that no single feature unfairly influences the final principal components. The result is that PCA will find the directions of maximum variance based on the actual spread of the data, not just the scale of the units.

### Step 2: Calculate the Covariance Matrix

**What is happening:** You compute a square matrix where the rows and columns are your features. Each element in this matrix, $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j)$, measures the covariance between two features, $X_i$ and $X_j$. The diagonal elements of this matrix are the variance of each individual feature, $\text{Var}(X_i)$.

**What it means:** The covariance matrix tells you how the different features in your dataset change together.
* **Positive covariance:** If $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) > 0$, it means that as feature $X_i$ increases, feature $X_j$ also tends to increase. They are positively correlated.
* **Negative covariance:** If $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) < 0$, it means that as feature $X_i$ increases, feature $X_j$ tends to decrease. They are negatively correlated.
* **Zero covariance:** If $\text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) \approx 0$, it means there is no clear linear relationship between the two features.

The covariance matrix provides a comprehensive summary of the linear relationships between all pairs of features in your dataset. This matrix is the key input for the next step.

### Step 3: Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

**What is happening:** This is the mathematical core of PCA. You perform an "eigendecomposition" on the covariance matrix. This process results in two outputs for each feature: an eigenvector and an eigenvalue.

**What it means:**
* **Eigenvectors:** An eigenvector is a special vector that, when a linear transformation (like the covariance matrix) is applied to it, only changes in magnitude, not direction. In the context of PCA, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the new directions, or axes, of your data. These are your **principal components**. They are orthogonal (perpendicular) to each other, meaning they represent independent directions of variance. The first eigenvector (PC1) is the direction of the greatest variance, the second (PC2) is the direction of the second greatest variance, and so on.
* **Eigenvalues:** An eigenvalue is the scalar value that corresponds to an eigenvector. It tells you the magnitude of the variance in the direction of its corresponding eigenvector. A large eigenvalue means that the variance along that eigenvector (principal component) is high. A small eigenvalue means the variance is low.

**In summary for this step:** Eigenvectors give you the new directions (the principal components), and their corresponding eigenvalues tell you how much information (variance) is captured by each of those directions.

### Step 4: Sort Eigenvectors by Eigenvalue and Select Principal Components

**What is happening:** You arrange the eigenvalues in descending order, from largest to smallest. You then select the corresponding eigenvectors for the top $k$ eigenvalues, where $k$ is the desired number of new dimensions.

**What it means:** This is the dimensionality reduction step. You're effectively saying, "I want to keep the directions that contain the most information about the data's spread, and I'm going to discard the directions that contain the least." A large eigenvalue indicates a principal component that explains a lot of the total variance in the data. By choosing the top eigenvectors, you're keeping the most important "directions" and throwing away the "directions" that are mostly noise. For example, if you have a dataset with 10 features, you might find that the first 2 principal components capture 95% of the total variance. You could then safely reduce the data from 10 dimensions to 2.

### Step 5: Transform the Original Data

**What is happening:** You take your original, standardized dataset and multiply it by the matrix of selected top $k$ eigenvectors (the principal components you chose in the previous step).

**What it means:** This final step projects your original data onto the new coordinate system defined by the principal components. The result is a new, lower-dimensional dataset where each data point is now represented by a set of scores on the new axes. This new dataset retains as much of the original variance as possible, while having fewer features. The first new feature is the score on the first principal component, the second is the score on the second principal component, and so on. These new features are uncorrelated, which is a significant advantage for many machine learning algorithms.

Excellent request. A numerical example makes the abstract concepts of PCA concrete. Let's work through a simple, two-dimensional example.

### The Problem
Imagine you have a small dataset with only two features, $X$ and $Y$. We have 5 data points:

| Point | $X$ | $Y$ |
| :---: | :-: | :-: |
| 1 | 2 | 4 |
| 2 | 3 | 5 |
| 3 | 4 | 6 |
| 4 | 5 | 7 |
| 5 | 6 | 8 |

If you were to plot this, you'd see a strong linear relationship. Our goal is to find the principal components, which will be the directions of maximum variance.

---

### Step 1: Standardize the Data

First, we need to calculate the mean ($\mu$) and standard deviation ($\sigma$) for each feature.

**For feature $X$:**
$\mu_X = (2+3+4+5+6) / 5 = 4$
$\sigma_X = \sqrt{\frac{(2-4)^2 + (3-4)^2 + (4-4)^2 + (5-4)^2 + (6-4)^2}{5-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{4+1+0+1+4}{4}} = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.581$

**For feature $Y$:**
$\mu_Y = (4+5+6+7+8) / 5 = 6$
$\sigma_Y = \sqrt{\frac{(4-6)^2 + (5-6)^2 + (6-6)^2 + (7-6)^2 + (8-6)^2}{5-1}} = \sqrt{\frac{4+1+0+1+4}{4}} = \sqrt{2.5} \approx 1.581$

Now, we standardize each point $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x'_i, y'_i)$ using the formula: $x' = (x - \mu_X) / \sigma_X$ and $y' = (y - \mu_Y) / \sigma_Y$.

| Point | $x'$ | $y'$ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $(2-4)/1.581 = -1.265$ | $(4-6)/1.581 = -1.265$ |
| 2 | $(3-4)/1.581 = -0.632$ | $(5-6)/1.581 = -0.632$ |
| 3 | $(4-4)/1.581 = 0$ | $(6-6)/1.581 = 0$ |
| 4 | $(5-4)/1.581 = 0.632$ | $(7-6)/1.581 = 0.632$ |
| 5 | $(6-4)/1.581 = 1.265$ | $(8-6)/1.581 = 1.265$ |

**What it means:** Our data is now centered at the origin $(0,0)$ and scaled appropriately. Notice that for this specific example, $x'_i = y'_i$ for every point. This is because the original data had a perfect linear relationship, $Y=X+2$.

---

### Step 2: Calculate the Covariance Matrix

Now, we calculate the covariance matrix for the standardized data. The formula for the covariance between two variables, $Cov(X, Y)$, is $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \mu_X)(y_i - \mu_Y)}{n-1}$. For standardized data, the mean is 0, so the formula simplifies to $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x'_i y'_i}{n-1}$. The variance is simply $\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x'_i)^2}{n-1}$.

The covariance matrix $C$ is:
$C = \begin{bmatrix} \text{Var}(X') & \text{Cov}(X',Y') \\ \text{Cov}(X',Y') & \text{Var}(Y') \end{bmatrix}$

$\text{Var}(X') = \frac{(-1.265)^2 + (-0.632)^2 + 0^2 + (0.632)^2 + (1.265)^2}{4} = \frac{1.6 + 0.4 + 0 + 0.4 + 1.6}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$
(This is expected, as we standardized the data to have a variance of 1).

$\text{Var}(Y') = \frac{(-1.265)^2 + (-0.632)^2 + 0^2 + (0.632)^2 + (1.265)^2}{4} = 1$
(Also expected).

$\text{Cov}(X',Y') = \frac{(-1.265)(-1.265) + (-0.632)(-0.632) + 0(0) + (0.632)(0.632) + (1.265)(1.265)}{4} = \frac{1.6 + 0.4 + 0 + 0.4 + 1.6}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1$

Our covariance matrix is:
$C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

**What it means:** The matrix shows us a very strong positive relationship. The covariance is 1, and the variance for each feature is also 1. This confirms our initial observation that $X$ and $Y$ are perfectly correlated.

---

### Step 3: Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

We need to solve the characteristic equation: $|C - \lambda I| = 0$, where $I$ is the identity matrix and $\lambda$ represents the eigenvalues.

$| \begin{bmatrix} 1-\lambda & 1 \\ 1 & 1-\lambda \end{bmatrix} | = 0$
$(1-\lambda)(1-\lambda) - (1)(1) = 0$
$1 - 2\lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0$
$\lambda^2 - 2\lambda = 0$
$\lambda(\lambda - 2) = 0$

This gives us two eigenvalues: $\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\lambda_2 = 0$.

Now we find the eigenvectors for each eigenvalue by solving $(C - \lambda I)v = 0$.

**For $\lambda_1 = 2$:**
$\begin{bmatrix} 1-2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1-2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_{11} \\ v_{12} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 1 \\ 1 & -1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_{11} \\ v_{12} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
This gives us the equation $-v_{11} + v_{12} = 0$, so $v_{11} = v_{12}$. A simple eigenvector is $[1, 1]^T$. We must normalize it to be a unit vector:
$e_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1^2+1^2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ 1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} 0.707 \\ 0.707 \end{bmatrix}$

**For $\lambda_2 = 0$:**
$\begin{bmatrix} 1-0 & 1 \\ 1 & 1-0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_{21} \\ v_{22} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
$\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} v_{21} \\ v_{22} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$
This gives us the equation $v_{21} + v_{22} = 0$, so $v_{21} = -v_{22}$. A simple eigenvector is $[1, -1]^T$. Normalizing it:
$e_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1^2+(-1)^2}} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1/\sqrt{2} \\ -1/\sqrt{2} \end{bmatrix} \approx \begin{bmatrix} 0.707 \\ -0.707 \end{bmatrix}$

**What it means:**
* **Eigenvalues:** The eigenvalues are 2 and 0. The first eigenvalue ($\lambda_1 = 2$) is much larger than the second ($\lambda_2 = 0$). This tells us that the first principal component captures all of the variance, while the second captures none. This makes sense, as our data points fall on a perfect line.
* **Eigenvectors:** The first eigenvector, $e_1 = [0.707, 0.707]^T$, points in the direction of the line where our data lies. This is the first principal component (PC1). The second eigenvector, $e_2 = [0.707, -0.707]^T$, is perpendicular to the first. It points in the direction where there is no variance at all, which is the direction perpendicular to the line of data.

---

### Step 4: Sort Eigenvectors and Select Principal Components

We sort the eigenvalues in descending order: $\lambda_1 = 2$, then $\lambda_2 = 0$.
The corresponding eigenvectors are $e_1$ and $e_2$.

Let's decide to reduce our data from 2 dimensions to 1. Since $\lambda_1 = 2$ accounts for $\frac{2}{2+0} = 100\%$ of the total variance, we only need the first principal component, $e_1$. We discard the second principal component.

**What it means:** We have found the single most important direction of variance in our data. We will now project our data onto this one-dimensional line.

---

### Step 5: Transform the Original Data

We take our standardized data and project it onto the new principal component axis. We do this by multiplying the standardized data matrix by the eigenvector matrix (which, in this case, is just a single eigenvector).

Let our standardized data matrix be $D'$, and our chosen eigenvector be $P$.
$D' = \begin{bmatrix} -1.265 & -1.265 \\ -0.632 & -0.632 \\ 0 & 0 \\ 0.632 & 0.632 \\ 1.265 & 1.265 \end{bmatrix}$ and $P = \begin{bmatrix} 0.707 \\ 0.707 \end{bmatrix}$

The new data, $D_{new}$, is calculated as $D' \cdot P$.

| Point | $PC1$ Score |
| :---: | :---: |
| 1 | $(-1.265 \cdot 0.707) + (-1.265 \cdot 0.707) = -1.789$ |
| 2 | $(-0.632 \cdot 0.707) + (-0.632 \cdot 0.707) = -0.894$ |
| 3 | $(0 \cdot 0.707) + (0 \cdot 0.707) = 0$ |
| 4 | $(0.632 \cdot 0.707) + (0.632 \cdot 0.707) = 0.894$ |
| 5 | $(1.265 \cdot 0.707) + (1.265 \cdot 0.707) = 1.789$ |

**What it means:** We have successfully reduced our two-dimensional data to a single dimension. Each point now has a single score, its projection onto the first principal component. This new one-dimensional representation captures 100% of the original variance, as all our data points lay perfectly on a line in the first place. For a more complex dataset, this would not be 100%, but it would still be the maximum possible variance captured by a single dimension.
Excellent, you're building a **complete PCA pipeline** by hand — very well done so far. Since you've already handled **Steps 1 to 5** beautifully, let's **recap each step with full interpretation**, then also briefly discuss **step 6: reconstruction (optional)**, **when to stop**, and **N×M rules**.

## ✅ Summary of Each Step in PCA with What’s Happening

### 🔹 Step 1: Standardize the Data

* **Why?** PCA is sensitive to scale.
* Each feature is transformed to have mean 0 and variance 1.
* This centers the data and ensures no feature dominates due to scale.

👉 You computed:

$$
x'_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_X}{\sigma_X},\quad y'_i = \frac{y_i - \mu_Y}{\sigma_Y}
$$

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Compute Covariance Matrix

* **Why?** We want to know how the variables vary **together**.
* The covariance matrix is symmetric:

  $$
  C = \begin{bmatrix}
  \text{Var}(X) & \text{Cov}(X,Y) \\
  \text{Cov}(Y,X) & \text{Var}(Y)
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$
* It captures linear relationships.

👉 You found that `Cov(X', Y') = 1`, indicating perfect linear correlation.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

* **Why?** Eigenvectors give **directions** (principal components).
* Eigenvalues tell **how much variance** is captured by each direction.

You solved:

$$
\det(C - \lambda I) = 0
$$

Found:

* Eigenvalues: `λ₁ = 2`, `λ₂ = 0`
* Eigenvectors: `[1, 1]^T`, `[1, -1]^T` (normalized)

🧠 **Interpretation:**

* PC1 points along the direction of maximum spread (the diagonal).
* PC2 is orthogonal and captures no variance (all points lie on a line).

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Sort & Select Principal Components

* Choose the top-k eigenvectors based on eigenvalues.
* In this case:

  * PC1 captures **100%** of variance → Keep only PC1.
* The goal is dimensionality reduction **without losing much info**.

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Transform the Data (Project)

* **Why?** Represent data in the new PC coordinate system.
* You compute:

$$
\text{Transformed data} = D' \cdot P
$$

Where `D'` is the standardized data and `P` is the matrix of selected eigenvectors.

You got:

| Original Point | PC1 Score |
| -------------- | --------- |
| (2,4)          | -1.789    |
| (3,5)          | -0.894    |
| (4,6)          | 0         |
| (5,7)          | 0.894     |
| (6,8)          | 1.789     |

👉 Interpretation: This is your new **compressed 1D representation** of the original 2D data.

---

## 🔹 Step 6 (Optional): Reconstruct the Original Data

* If you want to **reverse** PCA and reconstruct data from PC scores:

  $$
  \text{Original approx} = \text{PC scores} \times P^T
  $$
* If you keep fewer PCs than original dimensions, you get a **lossy approximation**.

This step helps you:

* Check **how much information was lost**.
* Visualize compression.

---

## ✅ How Many Principal Components to Keep?

Use any of:

1. **Scree Plot**: Look for "elbow".
2. **Cumulative Explained Variance**: Choose minimum $k$ such that:

   $$
   \sum_{i=1}^k \frac{\lambda_i}{\sum \lambda} \geq 90\%
   $$
3. **Domain knowledge**: Sometimes even 2 PCs suffice for visualization.

---

## ✅ What Size Data Is Required to Do PCA?

| Term | Meaning                                    |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| $N$  | Number of **data points** (rows)           |
| $M$  | Number of **features/variables** (columns) |

🔹 You need:

* $N > M$ usually, so the covariance matrix is **full-rank**.
* PCA is done on:

  * Either the **covariance matrix** of shape $M \times M$
  * Or **SVD on data matrix** (for high-dimensional cases)

---

## ✅ Key Insights

| Concept         | Interpretation                          |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Eigenvector     | Direction of variance (PC axis)         |
| Eigenvalue      | Magnitude of variance in that direction |
| Orthogonal PCs  | No redundancy, uncorrelated             |
| Standardization | Ensures equal feature importance        |
| Projection      | Data is represented in new rotated axes |

Would you like:

* Code version (NumPy + by hand)?
* A 3D example or visualization?
* Interview-style questions for PCA?

Let me know how you want to build on this.
Let's **manually walk through PCA step by step**, explaining **what is happening at each stage**, with the goal of deeply understanding it — **no shortcuts, full intuition**. This is aligned with what ISLR (Chapter 10.2) is trying to explain, but we’ll make it concrete and transparent.

---

## 🌟 What is PCA? (In simple but correct terms)

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a **dimensionality reduction** technique that:

* Finds **new axes** (called principal components) that are linear combinations of the original features.
* These new axes capture the **maximum variance** in the data.
* It **rotates** and **re-expresses** the data to simplify structure while losing as little information as possible.

---

## ✅ When to Use PCA?

* Your dataset has **many correlated features**.
* You want to **visualize** high-dimensional data.
* You want to **reduce noise** or **compress data**.
* You’re preparing for **clustering or regression** to avoid multicollinearity.

---

## 💡 Notation

Assume we have a dataset `X` of shape **N × M**:

* N = number of **observations** (rows)
* M = number of **features/variables** (columns)

To do PCA:

* You must have **N > M** (more data points than variables)
* All features should be **numeric and continuous**
* It's recommended to **standardize** (scale) your data

---

# 🔢 Step-by-Step Example (Do It By Hand)

Let’s use a **2D dataset** (so we can visualize and compute easily).

### 📊 Step 0: Input Data Matrix

We use this 3x2 matrix (3 samples, 2 features):

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
2.5 & 2.4 \\
0.5 & 0.7 \\
2.2 & 2.9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### 🧮 Step 1: Standardize the data (Center the data)

Why? PCA is sensitive to scale and origin.

Compute column-wise mean:

* Mean of column 1 = (2.5 + 0.5 + 2.2) / 3 = 1.733
* Mean of column 2 = (2.4 + 0.7 + 2.9) / 3 = 2.0

Now subtract the mean:

$$
X_{\text{centered}} = X - \text{mean} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
2.5 - 1.733 & 2.4 - 2.0 \\
0.5 - 1.733 & 0.7 - 2.0 \\
2.2 - 1.733 & 2.9 - 2.0 \\
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
0.767 & 0.4 \\
-1.233 & -1.3 \\
0.467 & 0.9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### 🧠 Step 2: Compute the Covariance Matrix

Why? Covariance shows how variables vary together. PCA uses this to find the directions of maximum variance.

Covariance matrix for 2 features:

$$
\text{Cov}(X) = \frac{1}{n-1} X^T X
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.767 & -1.233 & 0.467 \\
0.4 & -1.3 & 0.9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
0.767 & 0.4 \\
-1.233 & -1.3 \\
0.467 & 0.9 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This will give a **2x2 covariance matrix**:

$$
\text{Cov}(X) = \begin{bmatrix}
0.6166 & 0.615 \\
0.615 & 0.685 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

### 🧮 Step 3: Compute Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues

Why? Eigenvectors give directions (principal components). Eigenvalues tell you how much variance is along those directions.

Use numpy or solve:

$$
\text{Eigenvalues} ≈ 1.284, \quad 0.018
$$

$$
\text{Eigenvectors} ≈ 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.678 & -0.735 \\
0.735 & 0.678 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

* First PC: direction of maximum variance (explains 98% of total variance).
* Second PC: orthogonal to first, explains \~2% of variance.

---

### 🔁 Step 4: Project data onto new components

Multiply centered data with eigenvectors:

$$
Z = X_{\text{centered}} \cdot \text{eigenvectors}
$$

Gives new coordinates in PC space:

$$
Z = \begin{bmatrix}
0.827 \\
-1.777 \\
0.95 \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

You now have data in **principal component space**.

---

# 🔍 What is a Principal Component?

* A **direction** in the original feature space.
* It is a **unit vector** along which data shows **maximum variance**.
* The **first PC** explains the most variance, the second PC is orthogonal to the first, and so on.

---

# 📉 How Many PCs to Select?

Use:

1. **Scree Plot**: Plot eigenvalues. Look for an “elbow.”
2. **Proportion of Variance Explained**:

   * e.g., PC1 explains 98%, PC2 2% → keep just PC1.
3. **Cumulative Variance ≥ 90%** is a common rule.

---

## 🤔 Interpretation of PCA Output

* **Loadings** = how much each original feature contributes to a PC.
* **Scores** = transformed data (coordinates in PC space).
* **Eigenvalues** = amount of variance explained.
* **Orthogonality** = each PC is uncorrelated (no multicollinearity).

## 📌 Final Summary

| Step | Description                         |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- |
| 1    | Center and (optionally) scale data  |
| 2    | Compute covariance matrix           |
| 3    | Get eigenvalues and eigenvectors    |
| 4    | Select top K PCs                    |

## ✅ Output Shapes and Sizes

Let `X` be `N × M`:

* Covariance matrix → `M × M`
* Eigenvectors → `M × M` (each column = PC)
* Projected data → `N × K` if selecting K PCs

## 🔢 Dataset

Let’s take a small dataset with 5 points and 2 features:

| Observation | x1 | x2 |
| ----------- | -- | -- |
| A           | 2  | 0  |
| B           | 0  | 1  |
| C           | 3  | 1  |
| D           | 4  | 3  |
| E           | 5  | 4  |

So we have a **5x2 matrix**: 5 rows (samples), 2 columns (features).

### **Step 1: Standardize the Data (Mean 0, SD 1)**

We first center each column (feature) by subtracting its mean.

**Means:**

* mean(x1) = (2+0+3+4+5)/5 = 14/5 = **2.8**
* mean(x2) = (0+1+1+3+4)/5 = 9/5 = **1.8**

**Centered Data:**

| x1\_centered   | x2\_centered   |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 2 - 2.8 = -0.8 | 0 - 1.8 = -1.8 |
| 0 - 2.8 = -2.8 | 1 - 1.8 = -0.8 |
| 3 - 2.8 =  0.2 | 1 - 1.8 = -0.8 |
| 4 - 2.8 =  1.2 | 3 - 1.8 =  1.2 |
| 5 - 2.8 =  2.2 | 4 - 1.8 =  2.2 |

---

### **Step 2: Covariance Matrix**

Covariance matrix tells us how variables vary together.

Let `X` be the **centered data matrix**:

```
X = [[-0.8, -1.8],
     [-2.8, -0.8],
     [ 0.2, -0.8],
     [ 1.2,  1.2],
     [ 2.2,  2.2]]
```

Compute Covariance Matrix = (1 / n-1) × Xᵀ X

```python
import numpy as np

X = np.array([
    [-0.8, -1.8],
    [-2.8, -0.8],
    [ 0.2, -0.8],
    [ 1.2,  1.2],
    [ 2.2,  2.2]
])

cov_matrix = np.cov(X, rowvar=False)
print(np.round(cov_matrix, 2))
```

**Covariance Matrix:**

```
[[3.7  2.95]
 [2.95 2.8 ]]
```

---

### **Step 3: Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors**

These tell us:

* **Eigenvectors** → principal components (axes of new space)
* **Eigenvalues** → how much variance each component explains

```python
eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_matrix)
print("Eigenvalues:", eigvals)
print("Eigenvectors:\n", eigvecs)
```

Example Output:

```
Eigenvalues: [6.33 0.17]
Eigenvectors:
 [[ 0.75 -0.66]
 [ 0.66  0.75]]
```

* First eigenvalue (6.33) corresponds to the **first PC** (explains most variance).
* Eigenvectors are already **orthogonal** and normalized.

---

### **Step 4: Select Principal Components**

We choose the top **k** eigenvectors based on highest eigenvalues.

If we want to reduce to 1D:

* Select the first PC vector: `[0.75, 0.66]`

---

### **Step 5: Project Data onto Principal Components**

Transform original data into new coordinates:

```python
# Project original centered data onto first PC
PC1 = eigvecs[:, 0]   # Take the first eigenvector
X_proj = X.dot(PC1)
print(np.round(X_proj, 2))
```

Example Output (1D representation):

```
[-1.76, -2.24, -0.43, 1.71, 2.72]
```

Now each 2D point is mapped to 1 number — the projection on PC1.

---

## 🔍 Interpretation

* The **first principal component** is a direction that captures the most variance.
* You can plot original data + the principal component axis to **visualize rotation**.
* Variance explained by PC1 = 6.33 / (6.33 + 0.17) ≈ **97%** — almost all of it!

---

| 3    | Eigen decomposition (get PCs) |
| 4    | Select top-k PCs              |

## 📌 PCA Rules

* Works best when features are **correlated**
* All PCs are **orthogonal**
* You can do PCA when you have **more rows than columns** (e.g., 100x10)
* You must **scale** features when they’re on different units

Do you want the full **code for plotting**, or move to **interview questions and sklearn API**?
When interviewing for top-tier data science and machine learning roles, a deep conceptual understanding of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is essential. Interviewers want to see that you can go beyond the textbook definition and explain the intuition behind each step, its limitations, and its relationship to other techniques. Here's a breakdown of common questions and how to answer them to demonstrate a deep understanding.

### 1. "What is PCA, and what is its primary objective?"

**Answer:** Don't just say it's a dimensionality reduction technique. Frame it in terms of data transformation.

"PCA is a linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique. Its primary objective is to transform a dataset with a potentially large number of features into a new, smaller set of features called **principal components**. The key is that these new components are uncorrelated and are ordered by the amount of variance they explain. The first principal component captures the most variance, the second captures the next most, and so on. By keeping only the first few principal components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data while retaining as much of the original information (variance) as possible."

### 2. "Explain the role of the covariance matrix in PCA."

**Answer:** This is a crucial question that tests your understanding of the underlying mathematics.

"The covariance matrix is the foundation of PCA. After standardizing the data to have a mean of zero, the covariance matrix summarizes the linear relationships between all pairs of features. A positive covariance indicates that two features increase or decrease together, while a negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship. The diagonal elements of the matrix are the variances of each feature.

The covariance matrix is essential because it is from this matrix that we extract the eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The eigenvectors represent the principal components (the new axes), and the eigenvalues tell us how much variance is explained along each of those new axes. By performing this eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix, we find the directions of maximum variance in the data."

### 3. "What are eigenvectors and eigenvalues, and what do they represent in the context of PCA?"

**Answer:** Connect these abstract linear algebra concepts directly to the PCA process.

* **Eigenvectors:** "In PCA, the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are the **principal components**. They are a set of orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors that represent the new, transformed axes for our data. The first eigenvector is the first principal component, the second is the second principal component, and so on. They represent the directions in which the data varies the most."

* **Eigenvalues:** "The eigenvalues are scalar values corresponding to each eigenvector. An eigenvalue tells us the **magnitude of the variance** in the direction of its corresponding eigenvector. A larger eigenvalue means that its corresponding principal component captures more of the total variance in the dataset. This is why we sort the eigenvalues in descending order to rank the principal components by their importance."

### 4. "How do you determine the optimal number of principal components to keep?"

**Answer:** This tests your practical knowledge of using PCA.

"There are several common methods to determine the number of principal components ($k$):

* **Explained Variance Ratio:** The most common approach is to look at the cumulative explained variance. I would select the number of components that collectively explain a sufficient percentage of the total variance, such as 95% or 99%. This is often visualized using a scree plot.
* **Scree Plot (Elbow Method):** I would plot the eigenvalues in descending order. The 'elbow' of the plot, where the curve starts to flatten, suggests a good number of components to keep. After this point, each additional component adds only a small amount of explained variance.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Sometimes, domain expertise dictates the number of components. For instance, if you are compressing images, you might need a certain number of components to maintain a recognizable image.
* **Reconstruction Error:** In some cases, we can choose the number of components that minimizes the reconstruction error when we project the reduced-dimension data back into the original feature space."

### 5. "What is the relationship between PCA and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)?"

**Answer:** This is a top-tier question that separates those who just know the steps from those who understand the deeper linear algebra.

"PCA can be performed using either eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix or Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix. Mathematically, the two are very closely related. The principal components found by PCA are the same as the right singular vectors from SVD. The eigenvalues in PCA are proportional to the squared singular values from SVD.

However, using SVD is often preferred in practice for two key reasons:
1.  **Numerical Stability:** SVD is a more numerically stable method and can handle cases where the covariance matrix is not well-conditioned (e.g., when features are perfectly correlated).
2.  **Efficiency:** For very large, sparse datasets, SVD can be more computationally efficient as it avoids the explicit calculation of the covariance matrix, which can be massive."

### 6. "What are the limitations of PCA?"

**Answer:** Demonstrating awareness of the technique's weaknesses is a sign of a strong candidate.

"PCA is a powerful tool, but it's not a silver bullet. Its main limitations include:

* **Linearity:** PCA is a linear technique. It works best when the underlying structure of the data is linear. If the data has a complex, non-linear manifold, PCA might not be able to find a good low-dimensional representation. Techniques like Kernel PCA or t-SNE are better suited for these cases.
* **Outlier Sensitivity:** PCA is based on variance, and variance is highly sensitive to outliers. A single outlier can significantly affect the direction of the principal components. Preprocessing steps to handle outliers are often necessary.
* **Interpretability:** While the principal components are uncorrelated, they are linear combinations of the original features. This can make them difficult to interpret in a real-world context. For example, 'PC1' might be a combination of 'age' and 'income,' but it's hard to assign a simple meaning to it.
* **Label Agnostic:** As an unsupervised method, PCA does not consider class labels. It finds directions of maximum variance regardless of whether these directions are useful for separating different classes. This is a key difference from supervised dimensionality reduction techniques like Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)."

## 🔍 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – Interview Q\&A

---

### **1. What is PCA? Why do we use it?**

**Answer:**
PCA is a **dimensionality reduction** technique that projects data onto a set of **orthogonal directions (principal components)** that capture the **maximum variance** in the data.
We use PCA to:

* Reduce dimensionality and avoid the **curse of dimensionality**.
* **Visualize** high-dimensional data.
* **De-correlate features**.
* Improve efficiency or performance for downstream tasks like clustering/classification.

---

### **2. What is a principal component?**

**Answer:**
A principal component is a **linear combination of the original features**, chosen such that:

* **PC1** captures the **maximum variance** in the data.
* **PC2** captures the **next most variance**, orthogonal to PC1.
* And so on...

Each PC corresponds to an **eigenvector** of the data’s **covariance matrix**, and the variance it explains is the corresponding **eigenvalue**.

---

### **3. What are eigenvectors and eigenvalues in PCA?**

**Answer:**

* **Eigenvectors** define the **direction** of principal components.
* **Eigenvalues** measure the **amount of variance** captured along each principal component.

In PCA, we compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the **covariance matrix** of the data.

---

### **4. Why are the principal components orthogonal?**

**Answer:**
PCA solves an eigen-decomposition problem on the **symmetric covariance matrix**, whose eigenvectors are guaranteed to be **orthogonal** (by the spectral theorem).
Orthogonality ensures **uncorrelated components**, which simplifies analysis and avoids redundancy.

---

### **5. Should we scale the data before applying PCA?**

**Answer:**
Yes, **standardization (z-score scaling)** is crucial when features are on different scales.
PCA is sensitive to **absolute magnitudes**, and unscaled data can cause PCs to be biased toward higher-scale features.

---

### **6. How many principal components should you retain?**

**Answer:**
Several strategies:

* **Explained variance threshold**: Keep components until cumulative variance ≥ 90–95%.
* **Scree plot**: Look for the "elbow".
* **Kaiser’s rule**: Keep components with eigenvalue > 1.
* **Cross-validation**: Choose components that minimize error in downstream tasks.

---

### **7. What’s the difference between PCA and LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)?**

**Answer:**

| Feature   | PCA                   | LDA                         |
| --------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Type      | Unsupervised          | Supervised                  |
| Objective | Maximize variance     | Maximize class separability |
| Output    | Orthogonal components | Discriminant axes           |

---

### **8. Can PCA be used for classification?**

**Answer:**
PCA itself is **not a classifier**. But it is commonly used as a **preprocessing step** to:

* Reduce dimensionality,
* Remove noise, and
* Speed up training.

It may help classification but may also **remove discriminative features**, so use cautiously.

---

### **9. How do you interpret the principal components?**

**Answer:**
Each PC is a **linear combination** of input features with associated **loadings** (weights).
These loadings indicate **feature importance** in that direction.
E.g., if PC1 has large weights for "income" and "education", it suggests that variance is driven by those features.

---

### **10. How is PCA related to the covariance matrix?**

**Answer:**
PCA is fundamentally about **eigen-decomposing the covariance matrix** of the data.
The covariance matrix captures feature relationships, and its eigenvectors give directions of maximum variance (PCs), while eigenvalues give the **amount** of variance in those directions.

---

### **11. What are limitations of PCA?**

**Answer:**

* Assumes **linearity**.
* Sensitive to **scaling**.
* Difficult to interpret transformed axes.
* Doesn't account for **labels or classes**.
* Sensitive to **outliers**.
* Not ideal if most variance is **not useful** for task (e.g., classification).

---

### **12. How do you implement PCA from scratch?**

**Answer (Steps):**

1. Standardize data (mean 0, std 1).
2. Compute covariance matrix (if data is N×d, result is d×d).
3. Eigen-decompose covariance matrix.
4. Sort eigenvectors by decreasing eigenvalues.
5. Choose top-k PCs.
6. Project original data: `X_transformed = X × top_k_eigenvectors`.

---

### **13. When should you not use PCA?**

**Answer:**

* When features are **already low-dimensional**.
* When **interpretability** is important.
* When data is **categorical** (unless properly encoded).
* When the **variance** doesn’t correspond to useful signals (e.g., noise with high variance).

---

### **14. What’s the shape of the matrices in PCA?**

**Answer:**

* `X`: (N × d) — N samples, d features.
* Covariance matrix: (d × d)
* Eigenvectors: (d × d)
* Projected data: (N × k), where k is # of PCs retained.

---

### **15. What’s the difference between SVD and PCA?**

**Answer:**

| Feature     | PCA                          | SVD (Singular Value Decomp)    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Operates on | Covariance matrix            | Raw data matrix                |
| Output      | Eigenvectors and eigenvalues | U, Σ, Vᵀ matrices              |
| Advantage   | Intuitive, smaller matrix    | More stable for large datasets |

Modern implementations use **SVD** under the hood to perform PCA more efficiently.
