# Dynamic Revision Gap Analysis for Determining Generative AI Output Effectiveness via Updated Reference Comparisons

---

## FIELD OF THE INVENTION  
The present invention relates generally to quality assessment of automatically generated content and, more particularly, to a system and method for quantifying the divergence between a Generative AI–produced draft and its subsequently updated (e.g., human-edited or externally refined) version across multiple linguistic dimensions—without relying on human-provided labels.

---

## BACKGROUND AND PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED  

### Use Case & Motivation  
Organizations increasingly employ Generative AI (GenAI) systems to produce drafts of emails, reports, code snippets, legal summaries, marketing copy, and other content. After generation, these drafts typically undergo human post-editing, correction, or enhancement before final publication. Yet no robust, scalable tool exists to automatically answer critical questions such as:

1. **“How much and in what ways did the GenAI’s draft deviate from the final, human-approved version?”**  
2. **“Which types of revisions (e.g., grammatical, semantic, structural, stylistic, discourse-level) were most prevalent?”**  
3. **“Can we quantify GenAI effectiveness or model drift over time without requiring manual scores or labels?”**

Current approaches fall short because:  
- Traditional string-distance metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) focus primarily on surface-level overlaps and fail to distinguish meaning-preserving paraphrases from meaning-changing edits.  
- Document-diff tools (e.g., line-by-line comparators) flag every minor token change but do not capture semantic drift, rhetorical reordering, or shifts in implied intent.  
- Supervised “quality” models require labeled pairs (draft → final quality rating), which is prohibitively expensive and cannot scale across domains or modalities.

Consequently, there is a critical need for an automated, **unsupervised**, and **multi-dimensional** method to evaluate GenAI output quality by comparing each draft to its final, updated version—across five orthogonal linguistic dimensions—and then produce a composite, interpretable quality score, all without human-provided labels.

## SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND NOVELTY  

The invention provides a **Dynamic Revision Gap Analysis** system that:

1. **Accepts** as input a GenAI-generated draft (`D_gen`) and one or more updated reference versions (`D_final`), supporting multiple data modalities (natural language text, source code, structured data tables).  
2. **Decomposes** the revision process into five independent dimensions:  
   - **Syntactic** (token-level edits)  
   - **Semantic** (meaning preservation or drift)  
   - **Structural** (sentence/paragraph reordering)  
   - **Stylistic** (readability, complexity, tone)  
   - **Pragmatic/Discourse** (implied intent, logical entailment)  
3. **Computes** for each dimension a dimension-specific “difference score” using a **single, best-in-class automated method (no labels)**, as follows:  
   - **Syntactic:** Token-level normalized edit distance (Levenshtein over tokens)  
   - **Semantic:** Cosine-based distance between high-quality sentence embeddings (e.g., SBERT)  
   - **Structural:** Sentence-sequence similarity via Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of sentence units  
   - **Stylistic:** Delta in readability metrics (e.g., Flesch-Kincaid Grade) combined with sentence-complexity heuristics (average length, passive-voice ratio)  
   - **Pragmatic:** Natural Language Inference (NLI) entailment classification to detect shifts in implied meaning or contradiction  
4. **Applies** an **adaptive weighted scoring framework**—either fixed via domain templates or learned via unsupervised/self-supervised methods—to combine the five dimension scores into a **single composite Revision Gap Score (RGS)**.  
5. **Generates** human-readable **summaries** and **visualizations** of where and how revisions occurred (e.g., “Semantic deviation in paragraphs 2–3; stylistic simplification in sections 4–5; discourse shift in closing statements”).  
6. **Operates** in **real-time or batch** modes, and is **agnostic** to underlying GenAI model architecture (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, CodeGen, etc.).  
7. **Does not require** any human-labeled quality scores; instead, it leverages unsupervised clustering, variance normalization, or autoencoder-based feature-weight calibration to determine weights when supervision is absent.  

**Key Novel Aspects:**  
- **Five-Dimensional Decomposition:** While prior art may compare drafts and finals on a single axis (e.g., BLEU score), this invention simultaneously quantifies **syntactic, semantic, structural, stylistic, and pragmatic** revisions.  
- **Automated, Label-Free Dimension Scoring Methods:** Each dimension uses a carefully selected, unsupervised or pretrained technique that does not rely on annotated pairs.  
- **Adaptive Weighted Aggregation:** Unlike fixed formulae, this system can adjust weights based on domain (e.g., legal vs. creative), content type, or emergent revision patterns—enabling continuous model monitoring and drift detection.  
- **Multi-Modality Support:** The same architecture can handle plain text, code (via AST or token parsing), and structured data tables, applying analogous difference measures in each modality.  
- **Explanation Engine:** Beyond a numeric score, the invention produces granular, dimension-wise revision reports, facilitating audit, compliance, or feedback-driven model refinement.  

These features collectively establish a **novel, patentable** approach to GenAI evaluation that is **scalable, explainable, and domain-agnostic**.

## DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

### 1. System Architecture Overview  

The system consists of six major components, wired sequentially:

**1. Input Module**  
- **Function:** Receives the GenAI-generated draft (`D_gen`) and one or more updated reference versions (`D_final`).  
- **Capabilities:**  
  - Supports diverse data modalities:  
    - **Natural Language Text** (articles, emails, blog posts)  
    - **Source Code** (programming languages; parsed into Abstract Syntax Trees or token sequences)  
    - **Structured Data** (tables, JSON structures)  
  - Operates in **real-time** (streaming draft vs. ongoing edits) or **batch** (end-of-day collection) modes.  

**2. Preprocessing Module**  
- **Function:** Normalizes and segments input into units appropriate for each dimension’s analysis.  
- **Operations:**  
  - **Tokenization:** Splits text into tokens (words, punctuation, code tokens).  
  - **Sentence/Paragraph Segmentation:** Identifies sentence boundaries and logical paragraphs or code blocks.  
  - **Syntactic Parsing:** Builds parse trees for text (e.g., constituency/dependency trees) or Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) for code.  
  - **Modality-Specific Cleaning:** Strips metadata, normalizes whitespace, standardizes number/currency formats, removes boilerplate (e.g., disclaimers).  

**3. Feature Extraction Module**  
- **Function:** Computes dimension-specific features capturing differences between `D_gen` and `D_final`.  
- **Extracted Features:**  

  **a. Syntactic Features**  
  - **Token-Level Edit Distance:** Compute normalized Levenshtein distance over token sequences of `D_gen` vs. `D_final`.  
  - **Character-Level Edits (optional):** For case-sensitive or punctuation-sensitive domains.  
  - **Parse Tree Differences:** Count subtree edits in syntactic parse trees (text) or AST diffs (code).  

  **b. Semantic Features**  
  - **Sentence Embeddings:** Use a pretrained Sentence-BERT (or equivalent) to represent full document or aligned sentence pairs as vectors.  
  - **Cosine Similarity:** Calculate 1 − cosine(embedding(`D_gen`), embedding(`D_final`)).  
  - **NLI Signal (Auxiliary):** Determine if `D_gen` entails or contradicts `D_final` (used indirectly to flag extreme semantic drift).  

  **c. Structural Features**  
  - **Sentence Order LCS:** Compute the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) ratio between the sequence of sentences in `D_gen` and `D_final`.  
  - **Paragraph/Section Reordering:** Detect moved or newly inserted paragraphs/sections; compute the ratio of reordered blocks.  

  **d. Stylistic Features**  
  - **Readability Metrics:** Compute Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level (or SMOG, Gunning Fog) for `D_gen` and `D_final`; take absolute delta.  
  - **Sentence Complexity Statistics:** Average sentence length (words), passive-voice frequency (via simple parser), lexical diversity (type-token ratio).  

  **e. Pragmatic/Discourse Features**  
  - **Natural Language Inference (NLI):** Use a pretrained NLI model (e.g., RoBERTa-MNLI) to classify whether `D_final` is entailed by, contradictory to, or neutral with respect to `D_gen`.  
  - **Discourse Act Classification (optional):** Tag sentences with discourse roles (e.g., Background, Contrast, Consequence) and compare tag distributions.  

**4. Dynamic Revision Gap Analyzer**  
- **Function:** Aggregates the five dimension-specific “raw” difference scores into a **composite Revision Gap Score (RGS)** using a weighted-sum approach.  
- **Components:**  
  - **Weight Vector (W):**  
    ```  
    W = [w_syn, w_sem, w_str, w_sty, w_prg],   Σ w_i = 1  
    ```  
    Weights may be:  
    - **Fixed:** Predefined by domain templates (e.g., Legal: w_sem = 0.40, w_prg = 0.25, w_str = 0.15, w_sty = 0.10, w_syn = 0.10).  
    - **Adaptive:** Learned via unsupervised/self-supervised strategies (e.g., clustering, variance-based normalization, autoencoder reconstruction error).  
  - **Dimension Scores (R):**  
    ```  
    R = [r_syn, r_sem, r_str, r_sty, r_prg]  
    ```  
    where each r_i is a normalized [0, 1] score per dimension.  
  - **Composite RGS Calculation:**  
    ```  
    RGS = Σ (w_i × r_i)  
    ```  
- **Features:**  
  - **Support for Supervised/RL Weight Learning:** If a small set of human-annotated revision preferences becomes available, weights can be fine-tuned via a supervised loss or used as a reward in a reinforcement learning loop.  
  - **Unsupervised Self-Calibration:** In the absence of any labels, the system can compute each feature’s variance over a large corpus of GenAI → human-edit pairs, then use inverse-variance normalization (or heuristic clustering) to assign weights proportionally (higher variance → lower weight, and vice versa).  

**5. Explanation Engine**  
- **Function:** Generates detailed, human-readable explanations of revision differences.  
- **Outputs:**  
  - **Sentence-Level Annotations:** Tags each sentence or code block as “Unchanged,” “Syntax Edit,” “Semantic Edit,” etc.  
  - **Dimension Breakdown:** Shows dimension-wise contributions to RGS (e.g., “Syntactic: 0.12, Semantic: 0.05, Structural: 0.08, Stylistic: 0.03, Pragmatic: 0.00”).  
  - **Visualization:** Heatmaps or highlighted diffs indicating where significant changes occurred.  
- **Applications:**  
  - **Audit Reporting:** For compliance or editorial teams to review major divergences.  
  - **Model Feedback:** Supply examples where the GenAI model “failed” semantically or pragmatically, guiding retraining.  

**6. Output Module**  
- **Function:** Exposes the computed RGS and detailed explanations to downstream consumers.  
- **Formats:**  
  - **API Response:** JSON object containing RGS, dimension scores, and optional annotations.  
  - **Dashboard Widget:** Visual summary integrating heatmaps and scores over time.  
  - **Log Files:** Append structured logs for historical analysis or compliance audits.

### 2. Detailed Dimension Scoring Methods (Label-Free)

Below is a summary of the **sole method** selected for each dimension—carefully chosen for its ability to operate without labeled training examples:

1. **Syntactic Difference**  
   - **Normalized Token Levenshtein Distance (r_syn):**  
     ```  
     r_syn = LevenshteinDistance(Tokens(D_gen), Tokens(D_final))  
             / max(|Tokens(D_gen)|, |Tokens(D_final)|)  
     ```  
   - **Rationale:** Directly measures the proportion of word-level edits needed to transform `D_gen` into `D_final`. It is insensitive to domain, requires no annotations, and is interpretable.

2. **Semantic Difference**  
   - **Sentence-Embedding Cosine Distance (r_sem):**  
     - Compute document embedding as the mean of sentence embeddings from a pretrained SBERT model.  
     - Calculate:  
       ```  
       r_sem = 1 − cosine(Embedding(D_gen), Embedding(D_final))  
       ```  
   - **Rationale:** Embeddings encapsulate contextual meaning, capturing paraphrases or fact-level changes that surface metrics miss. Operating in a zero-label regime, SBERT requires no fine-tuning for general text.

3. **Structural Difference**  
   - **Sentence-LCS Ratio (r_str):**  
     ```  
     r_str = 1 − (LCS_Length(Sentences(D_gen), Sentences(D_final))  
                   / max(|Sentences(D_gen)|, |Sentences(D_final)|))  
     ```  
   - **Rationale:** By treating each sentence as a unit, LCS reveals how many sentences (or code blocks) remain in the same order. It highlights reordering or insertion/deletion at a macro-structural level, without being overly sensitive to minor token changes.

4. **Stylistic Difference**  
   - **Delta Readability (r_sty):**  
     ```  
     r_sty = |Readability(D_gen) − Readability(D_final)| / Max_Readability_Delta  
     ```  
     Here, `Readability()` may be computed via Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Optionally, normalize further by also incorporating average sentence length or percentage of passive voice.  
   - **Rationale:** Human editors frequently adjust tone, complexity, or formality. A simple delta in readability grade level (and related sentence-stats) captures that shift reliably and without supervision.

5. **Pragmatic / Discourse Difference**  
   - **NLI Entailment Score (r_prg):**  
     - Run a pretrained NLI model (e.g., RoBERTa-MNLI) on the pair [`D_gen`, `D_final`].  
     - Assign:  
       ```  
       if NLI_label == “ENTAILMENT”:    r_prg = 0  
       elif NLI_label == “NEUTRAL”:     r_prg = 0.5  
       elif NLI_label == “CONTRADICTION”:r_prg = 1  
       ```  
   - **Rationale:** Captures whether the final text preserves, modifies, or contradicts the GenAI’s implied statements. This approach is domain-agnostic and requires no labeled examples. Even “neutral” can indicate a pragmatic shift.
r_syn, r_sem, r_str, r_sty, r_prg


the system produces a **composite Revision Gap Score (RGS)**:


**Weight Selection Modes:**  
1. **Manual / Domain-Expert Weights:**  
   - Example: For legal documents, set  
     ```
     w_sem = 0.40,  w_prg = 0.30,  w_str = 0.10,  w_sty = 0.10,  w_syn = 0.10
     ```  
   - Rationale: Emphasize semantic correctness and legal consistency over style.

2. **Unsupervised Self-Calibration:**  
   - Collect a large corpus of GenAI→final pairs over time.  
   - Compute each dimension’s variance σ_i². Assign weights inversely proportional to variance:  
     ```
     w_i = (1 / σ_i²) / Σ(1 / σ_j²)  
     ```  
   - Rationale: Dimensions with high variability (i.e., inconsistent human edits) are downweighted; stable dimensions gain more weight, reflecting domain conventions.

3. **Reinforcement Learning (Optional Supervision):**  
   - If a small set of human-rated revision “goodness” scores becomes available, define a reward function that encourages alignment between RGS and human scores.  
   - Use policy gradient or gradient descent to adjust `W = [w_syn, w_sem, w_str, w_sty, w_prg]`.
