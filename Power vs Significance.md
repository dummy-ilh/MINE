# 📊 Power vs Significance in Hypothesis Testing and Model Selection

## 🔍 1. Hypothesis Testing: Basics

Let’s define the key components:

* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)**: No effect, no difference.
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$)**: There is an effect, or a difference.
* **Significance Level ($\alpha$)**: The probability of rejecting $H_0$ when it is true (Type I error).
* **Power ($1 - \beta$)**: The probability of correctly rejecting $H_0$ when $H_1$ is true (i.e., avoiding a Type II error).

### 📌 Definitions Recap:

| Metric                      | Meaning                                          | Error Type        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Significance ($\alpha$)** | $P(\text{Reject } H_0 \mid H_0 \text{ is true})$ | Type I Error      |
| **Power ($1 - \beta$)**     | $P(\text{Reject } H_0 \mid H_1 \text{ is true})$ | 1 − Type II Error |

## 🧠 2. Deep Concepts: Trade-off Between Power and Significance

### 🔄 **The Trade-Off**

* **Lowering $\alpha$** (i.e., making the test stricter):

  * Reduces false positives (Type I errors)
  * But increases false negatives (Type II errors) → **reduces power**
* **Increasing $\alpha$**:

  * Increases chance of detecting an effect (higher power)
  * But also increases risk of false positives.

👉 You cannot minimize both errors simultaneously without increasing **sample size** or improving **test sensitivity**.

## 📈 3. Visual Interpretation

```
|                |     Accept H₀     |     Reject H₀     |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| H₀ True        | Correct (1 - α)  | Type I Error (α)  |
| H₁ True        | Type II Error (β)| Power (1 - β)     |
```

Think of power and significance as sensitivity vs specificity — changing one affects the other.

## 🧪 4. In Model Selection Context

When selecting between models (e.g., nested models in linear regression, AIC/BIC in ML):

### ✅ **Significance Level**:

* Used in **Likelihood Ratio Tests**, **F-tests**, **ANOVA**, etc.
* A small p-value (< $\alpha$) implies rejecting the simpler model in favor of the complex one.

### ✅ **Power**:

* Ability to detect when a more complex model **truly improves** fit.
* A test with low power may **fail to detect true effects**, leading you to select an underfit model.

---

## ⚖️ 5. Practical Scenarios

### 💡 Example 1: A/B Testing

* $H_0$: Variant B is not better than A
* $\alpha = 0.05$, Power = 0.8
* If you increase power to 0.95, you’ll need **larger sample size**.

### 💡 Example 2: Feature Selection in ML

* Using hypothesis testing (e.g., p-values of coefficients)
* **Low power** means you might **miss important predictors**
* **Too strict $\alpha$** may exclude useful variables

---

## 🧮 6. Equation Perspective

For testing $H_0: \theta = \theta_0$ vs $H_1: \theta \ne \theta_0$:

* Test statistic $T = \frac{\hat{\theta} - \theta_0}{SE(\hat{\theta})}$
* Power function:

  $$
  \text{Power}(\theta) = P_{\theta}\left(\text{Reject } H_0\right)
  $$

This depends on:

* Effect size: $|\theta - \theta_0|$
* Variance: $\sigma^2$
* Sample size: $n$
* $\alpha$

## 🎯 7. Interview Insight

> “Why not always set $\alpha = 0.01$ to be safe?”

→ Because **you might drastically reduce power** and miss real effects, especially with small sample sizes.

> “Why is power important in model validation?”

→ High power ensures you don’t falsely conclude that added complexity (like new features) doesn't improve the model.

## 🛠️ 8. Final Thoughts: How to Increase Power

* Increase sample size $n$
* Choose more sensitive test statistics
* Use directional (one-sided) tests if justified
* Reduce variance in measurements

| **$\beta$**     | Probability of false negative                    | Missed effects      |
| **Effect Size** | True difference magnitude                        | Larger → More power |

Imagine a graph of:

* **x-axis**: True effect size
* **y-axis**: Power
* It increases as effect size or sample size increases.

Here are **tricky and conceptual questions** around **Power vs Significance**, especially for **interviews**, **model validation**, and **hypothesis testing**. These test **deep understanding**, not just textbook definitions.

# 🎯 Power vs Significance – Tricky Conceptual Interview Questions

## 🔥 1. Why can't we just reduce both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to near zero?

**Trick**: Sounds ideal—low Type I and Type II errors.
**Answer**: You can't reduce both without increasing sample size. There's a **fundamental trade-off**: lowering $\alpha$ (stricter test) often **increases $\beta$** (missed detections). Only **larger $n$** or **stronger signal** can reduce both.

---

## 🧠 2. If I increase the significance level from 0.01 to 0.10, what happens to power?

**Answer**: Power **increases** because you're now more willing to reject $H_0$. But this also means you're **more prone to false positives (Type I error)**.

---

## 🧪 3. Can a test with high power still be statistically insignificant?

**Trick**: Power is about true positives, significance is about rejecting $H_0$.
**Answer**: Yes. Power is a **pre-study** property (depends on effect size, sample size). You might have **high power**, but **your observed data** didn’t show a significant effect (just by chance).

---

## ⚠️ 4. If a result is not statistically significant, can we conclude the effect is absent?

**Trick**: Many do this.
**Answer**: **No**. A non-significant result may be due to **low power**, not because there’s no real effect. It’s a **failure to detect**, not proof of no effect.

---

## 📏 5. Does increasing sample size always increase power?

**Answer**: **Yes**, because larger $n$ reduces standard error, making it easier to detect small effects. But the **magnitude of the gain** depends on the **effect size** — for **very small true effects**, even large $n$ may yield low power.

---

## 🔁 6. Can a test with a low $\alpha$ have high power?

**Answer**: Only if:

* The **sample size is large**, or
* The **effect size is large**

Low $\alpha$ means stricter criteria to reject $H_0$. To maintain power, you need **more certainty in your data**.

---

## ⚔️ 7. What’s worse — Type I or Type II error?

**Trick**: No universal answer.
**Answer**: Depends on context. In:

* **Medical testing**: Type I error (false claim of efficacy) can harm many.
* **Cancer detection**: Type II error (missing cancer) is worse.

Choose $\alpha$ and target power based on **domain-specific risks**.

---

## 🔂 8. How is power affected in multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni)?

**Answer**: Bonferroni correction **reduces $\alpha$** for each test → **increases $\beta$** → **reduces power**. You're more cautious but more likely to **miss real effects**. This is a **power–FDR trade-off**.

---

## 🧮 9. Why is statistical power important in model selection?

**Answer**: Low power can cause you to **miss improvements** in model fit (like dropping variables that truly matter). Especially with:

* **Stepwise regression**
* **Nested model comparisons**

You'll **underfit** if the model selection process can't **detect true but subtle effects**.

---

## ⚖️ 10. You set $\alpha = 0.05$ and your p-value is 0.049. What does this mean?

**Trick**: Many would say "significant."
**Answer**: Technically yes, but it's **barely significant** and highly **sensitive to data noise**. Plus, it says nothing about **practical significance** or power. Consider **effect size and confidence interval** too.

---

## 🧊 11. Can a high p-value occur even if the true effect is large?

**Answer**: Yes — if the **sample size is small**, variance is high, or power is low. This is why **non-significant ≠ no effect**.

---

## 🔍 12. Why can low-powered studies still produce significant p-values?

**Trick**: Power is pre-study.
**Answer**: Due to **random chance**, you can get a significant result — but it's **less likely to replicate**. That’s why **low power inflates false discovery rate** even if $\alpha = 0.05$.

---

## 🧩 13. You're given two studies:

* Study A: Large sample, p = 0.06
* Study B: Small sample, p = 0.04
  Which result is more trustworthy?

**Answer**: Likely **Study A**. Even though p = 0.06, large $n$ makes the estimate more **precise** and stable. Study B might have gotten a lucky p-value with **high variance**.

---

## 🧬 14. Is statistical significance a property of the data or the test?

**Answer**: Of the **data**, relative to the **test threshold**.
Power, in contrast, is a property of the **test design** (before seeing the data).

---

## 🛠️ 15. Why do underpowered studies tend to **overestimate effect sizes**?

**Answer**: Because **only the extreme values** (due to chance) pass the significance threshold in low-powered settings → **selection bias**. This is called the **"winner’s curse"** in science.
