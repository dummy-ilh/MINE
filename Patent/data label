Title:
System and Method for Automated Data Labeling Using Large Language Models with Dynamic Feedback Loop

Abstract:
The invention provides a system and method for automated data labeling leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The system dynamically generates label descriptions, processes unlabeled data iteratively, and labels data based on prompts generated from user-defined rules. It incorporates a feedback loop for validation, enabling continuous improvement by updating prompts and validation criteria based on user feedback. This ensures efficient and accurate labeling of datasets, reducing manual effort and enhancing model training for machine learning applications.

Background:
Traditional data labeling processes are labor-intensive and prone to human errors, particularly when dealing with large datasets. Existing automated systems lack the ability to dynamically adapt labeling criteria based on real-time feedback. The integration of LLMs introduces a novel mechanism to understand and apply complex labeling rules, ensuring scalability and accuracy. However, challenges remain in validation, adaptability, and reducing bias in labeled outputs.

Summary:
The proposed system comprises the following components:

Prompt Generator: Dynamically creates label descriptions based on user-provided rules or dataset context.
Data Processor: Iteratively processes unlabeled data, applying LLM-based prompts to generate labels.
Validation Module: Compares labeled data against predefined criteria or user-provided feedback.
Feedback Loop: Records incorrect labels, tracks feedback items, and updates prompts when a predefined threshold (e.g., 5 feedback items) is reached.
Permutation Subsystem: Computes valid permutations for specific labeling tasks, ensuring comprehensive coverage of possible label assignments.
Output Module: Produces labeled data, with indicators for validation confidence and any anomalies.
The system operates continuously until all data is labeled and validated, enabling the use of high-quality labeled data for machine learning model training.
