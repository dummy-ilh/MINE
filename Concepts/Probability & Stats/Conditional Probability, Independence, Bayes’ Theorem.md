## üéØ 1. Conditional Probability ‚Äî Intuition and Definition

### üîπ Intuition

Conditional probability measures the **likelihood of an event A occurring given that another event B has already occurred**.

It answers:

> ‚ÄúGiven that B happened, how likely is A?‚Äù

---

### üîπ Formal Definition

[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}, \quad \text{where } P(B) > 0
]

* ( P(A|B) ): Probability of A **given** B
* ( P(A \cap B) ): Probability that **both** A and B occur
* ( P(B) ): Probability that B occurs

---

### üîπ Example

A deck has 52 cards.
Let:

* ( A ): event of drawing a **King**
* ( B ): event of drawing a **Spade**

We want ( P(A|B) ): Probability of getting a King **given that the card is a Spade**.

[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
]

* ( P(B) = 13/52 = 1/4 )  (13 spades)
* ( P(A \cap B) = 1/52 )  (only the King of Spades)

[
P(A|B) = \frac{1/52}{1/4} = \frac{1}{13}
]

‚úÖ Interpretation: If you already know the card is a Spade, there‚Äôs a 1 in 13 chance it‚Äôs a King.

---

## üéØ 2. Multiplication Rule

From the definition:
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A|B) \cdot P(B)
]

This can be rearranged or extended:
[
P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A|B \cap C) \cdot P(B|C) \cdot P(C)
]

This rule is essential for **Bayesian networks**, **Markov chains**, and **probabilistic graphical models**.

---

## üéØ 3. Independence

### üîπ Definition

Two events **A** and **B** are **independent** if the occurrence of one does **not affect** the probability of the other.

Formally:
[
P(A|B) = P(A)
]
or equivalently,
[
P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)
]

---

### üîπ Example

If you flip two fair coins:

Let

* ( A ): first coin is heads
* ( B ): second coin is heads

Then:
[
P(A) = 1/2, \quad P(B) = 1/2, \quad P(A \cap B) = 1/4
]

Check independence:
[
P(A)P(B) = 1/4 = P(A \cap B)
]

‚úÖ Hence, A and B are independent.

---

## üéØ 4. Conditional Independence

Two events A and B may **not** be independent, but they can become **independent given a third event C**.

[
P(A \cap B | C) = P(A|C) \cdot P(B|C)
]

This is crucial in **Bayesian networks**, where dependencies are represented conditionally.

---

### üîπ Example: Medical Diagnosis

Let:

* ( D ): Patient has a disease
* ( T_1, T_2 ): Results of two medical tests

Normally ( T_1 ) and ( T_2 ) are correlated (if one is positive, the other likely is too).
But if we know whether the disease ( D ) is present, the test results are **conditionally independent** given ( D ).

---

## üéØ 5. Bayes‚Äô Theorem (Built on Conditional Probability)

[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
]

* ( P(A) ): Prior probability
* ( P(B|A) ): Likelihood
* ( P(A|B) ): Posterior probability
* ( P(B) ): Evidence (normalizing factor)

This theorem flips the conditioning and is **fundamental in AI, machine learning, and data inference**.

# Bayes‚Äô Theorem ‚Äî what it is **and** why it matters (detailed)

Bayes‚Äô Theorem is a rule for updating probabilities (beliefs) in the light of new evidence. It tells you how to go from a **prior** belief about a hypothesis to a **posterior** belief after seeing data ‚Äî using the likelihood of that data under the hypothesis.

---

## 1. The formula (single hypothesis)

[
P(H \mid E) ;=; \frac{P(E \mid H),P(H)}{P(E)}
]

* (H) = hypothesis (e.g., ‚Äúpatient has the disease‚Äù).
* (E) = evidence / observation (e.g., ‚Äútest is positive‚Äù).
* (P(H)) = prior probability of (H) before seeing (E).
* (P(E \mid H)) = likelihood: probability of seeing (E) if (H) is true.
* (P(H \mid E)) = posterior: updated probability of (H) after seeing (E).
* (P(E)) = marginal probability (evidence), ensures the result is normalized.

---

## 2. Where it comes from (quick derivation)

Start from conditional probability definition:
[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(H \cap E)}{P(E)}.
]
Also
[
P(H \cap E) = P(E \mid H),P(H).
]
Combine them:
[
P(H \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H),P(H)}{P(E)}.
]

So Bayes is simply rearranging the multiplication rule for conditional probability.

---

## 3. The denominator ‚Äî the Law of Total Probability

To compute (P(E)) we usually use all mutually exclusive hypotheses (H) and (\neg H) (or more hypotheses):

For two outcomes:
[
P(E) = P(E \mid H)P(H) + P(E \mid \neg H)P(\neg H).
]

For multiple hypotheses (H_1,\dots,H_n) (mutually exclusive, exhaustive):
[
P(H_i \mid E) = \frac{P(E \mid H_i)P(H_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} P(E \mid H_j)P(H_j)}.
]

This ensures the posterior probabilities across hypotheses sum to 1.

---

## 4. Intuition ‚Äî ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it makes sense

Think of Bayes in three steps:

1. **Start** with a prior belief (P(H)).
2. **Observe evidence** (E). Ask: how likely is that evidence if (H) were true? That‚Äôs (P(E\mid H)).
3. **Combine** them: multiply prior by likelihood (gives joint probability of ‚ÄúH and E‚Äù), then divide by the total probability of E so you get a normalized (conditional) probability.

So Bayes weights the prior by how well the hypothesis predicts the evidence, and renormalizes.

---

## 5. Worked numeric example (medical test) ‚Äî step-by-step arithmetic

**Problem setup:**

* Disease prevalence (prior): (P(D)=0.01) (1%).
* Test sensitivity: (P(+ \mid D)=0.99) (99% chance test positive if diseased).
* Test specificity: (P(- \mid \neg D)=0.95) (95% chance test negative if healthy).
  ‚Üí So false positive rate (P(+ \mid \neg D) = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05).

We want (P(D \mid +)): probability patient has disease given a positive test.

Apply Bayes:
[
P(D \mid +) = \frac{P(+ \mid D) P(D)}{P(+)}
]
where
[
P(+) = P(+ \mid D)P(D) + P(+ \mid \neg D)P(\neg D).
]

Compute numerator and denominator step-by-step:

1. (P(+ \mid D) P(D) = 0.99 \times 0.01).

   * (0.99 \times 0.01 = 0.0099.)

2. Prior for no disease: (P(\neg D) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99.)

3. (P(+ \mid \neg D) P(\neg D) = 0.05 \times 0.99.)

   * (0.05 \times 0.99 = 0.0495.)

4. Total (P(+)=0.0099 + 0.0495 = 0.0594.)

5. Posterior:
   [
   P(D \mid +) = \frac{0.0099}{0.0594}.
   ]

Simplify fraction:

* Multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to clear decimals: (\frac{99}{594}).
* Divide numerator and denominator by 9: (\frac{11}{66}).
* Divide both by 11: (\frac{1}{6} = 0.166666\ldots).

So (P(D \mid +) \approx 0.1667) ‚Üí **~16.7%**.

**Interpretation:** Even with a very accurate test (99% sensitivity), a positive test is far more likely to be a false positive than to mean the patient truly has the disease when the disease is rare (1%). This is the classic *base-rate effect*.

---

## 6. Odds form and log-odds (useful shortcut)

Bayes in odds:
[
\text{Posterior odds} = \text{Prior odds} \times \text{Likelihood ratio}.
]
Where likelihood ratio (= \dfrac{P(E\mid H)}{P(E\mid \neg H)}).

Log-odds (logits) make multiplication additive:
[
\log \text{Posterior odds} = \log \text{Prior odds} + \log \text{Likelihood ratio}.
]

This form is handy in sequential updating or with very small numbers.

---

## 7. Continuous extension (densities)

When (E) is a continuous observation (x), replace probabilities with densities (f(x\mid\theta)) and priors (\pi(\theta)):

[
\pi(\theta \mid x) = \frac{f(x \mid \theta),\pi(\theta)}{\int f(x \mid \theta'),\pi(\theta'),d\theta'}.
]

This is Bayesian parameter inference ‚Äî posterior density ‚àù likelihood √ó prior density.

---

## 8. Terminology recap (short)

* **Prior**: belief before data.
* **Likelihood**: how likely data is under hypothesis.
* **Evidence** (marginal): probability of data under all hypotheses.
* **Posterior**: updated belief after seeing data.

---

## 9. When & why to use Bayes

* When you need to update beliefs with new evidence.
* In medical diagnosis, spam filters, machine learning (Bayesian inference), A/B testing, fault diagnosis, and decision making under uncertainty.
* When prior information matters (small data scenarios).

---

## 10. Common pitfalls & cautions

1. **Base-rate neglect**: Ignoring the prior prevalence leads to overconfident conclusions (see numeric example).
2. **Wrong model / likelihood**: If (P(E\mid H)) is wrong, posterior is misleading.
3. **Subjective priors**: Priors can be subjective ‚Äî choose and justify them; check sensitivity.
4. **Zero prior problem**: If (P(H)=0), you can never get a nonzero posterior, no matter the evidence.
5. **Dependence of data**: Bayes assumes you model dependencies correctly; naive independence assumptions (e.g., Naive Bayes) simplify but can be wrong.

---

## 11. Useful variants & concepts

* **Bayes for many hypotheses** (multi-class) ‚Äî use the denominator as a sum across hypotheses.
* **Conjugate priors** ‚Äî priors chosen so posterior is same family as prior (e.g., Beta prior with Bernoulli likelihood). This yields closed-form posteriors and is widely used in practice.
* **Empirical Bayes** ‚Äî estimate prior from data.
* **Bayesian vs Frequentist** ‚Äî Bayes treats parameters as random; frequentists treat them as fixed but unknown.

---

## 12. Short worked Bayesian update (coin toss + Beta prior)

If you want, I can show a Beta-Bernoulli conjugate example (prior Beta(2,2), see 10 coin flips, compute posterior Beta(...) and a credible interval) ‚Äî say the word and I‚Äôll compute it step-by-step.

---

## 13. Quick problem to try (and how to solve it)

**Problem:** A disease has prevalence 0.5%. Test A has sensitivity 95% and specificity 90%. If a patient tests positive, what is the probability they have the disease?

**How to solve:** apply the same steps as the worked example:

1. Compute prior, sensitivity, false positive rate.
2. Compute (P(+)=P(+|D)P(D)+P(+|\neg D)P(\neg D)).
3. Compute posterior (P(D|+)=\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)}).

Perfect question üëè ‚Äî the **Monty Hall problem** *confuses almost everyone* the first time (even math PhDs).
But once you see it **visually and logically**, it becomes clear.
Let‚Äôs go **slowly, step by step**, and then we‚Äôll confirm it with probabilities and intuition.

---

## üéØ The Monty Hall Setup

You‚Äôre on a game show.
There are **3 doors**:

* Behind **1** door is a **car** üöó (you want this).
* Behind the other **2** are **goats** üêêüêê (you don‚Äôt want these).

You pick one door ‚Äî say, **Door 1**.

Now, before revealing what‚Äôs behind your door,
the host (**Monty**) ‚Äî who **knows where the car is** ‚Äî opens **another door** that he knows has a **goat** behind it.

Then he offers you a choice:

> "Do you want to **stick** with your original door or **switch** to the other unopened one?"

---

## ‚ùì The Question

Should you:

* **Stay** with your first choice, or
* **Switch** to the other unopened door?

Which gives you the higher chance of winning the car?

---

## üß† Step-by-Step Logic (The Key Insight)

### Step 1: Initial probability

When you choose your door at the start:

* Probability **you picked the car** = ( \frac{1}{3} )
* Probability **you picked a goat** = ( \frac{2}{3} )

That‚Äôs the starting situation.

---

### Step 2: Monty opens a goat door

Monty now **removes one losing option** (he‚Äôll *never* open the car door).

* If you **initially picked the car** (1/3 chance):
  ‚Üí Monty opens one of the two goats.
  ‚Üí Switching will make you **lose**.

* If you **initially picked a goat** (2/3 chance):
  ‚Üí Monty opens the *other* goat door.
  ‚Üí The remaining closed door must be the **car**.
  ‚Üí Switching will make you **win**.

---

### Step 3: Compare probabilities

| Case | What you picked | Monty opens | If you switch | Probability |
| ---- | --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| 1    | Car             | Goat        | Lose          | 1/3         |
| 2    | Goat #1         | Goat #2     | Win           | 1/3         |
| 3    | Goat #2         | Goat #1     | Win           | 1/3         |

So:

* Staying wins **1/3 of the time**.
* Switching wins **2/3 of the time**. ‚úÖ

---

## üéØ Final Answer

üëâ **Switching doubles your chances of winning** (from 1/3 to 2/3).

---

## ü™Ñ Why it feels wrong (the psychological trap)

Most people think:

> ‚ÄúAfter Monty opens a door, there are 2 doors left, so it‚Äôs 50‚Äì50.‚Äù

That *seems* logical, but it **ignores information** ‚Äî Monty‚Äôs action is *not random*.
He **always** opens a goat door, and his choice *depends* on where the car actually is.

Monty‚Äôs behavior gives you **extra information**, which changes the probabilities.

---

## üé® Visual Example (imagine 3 scenarios)

Let‚Äôs label:

* Door A = your choice
* Door B = Monty‚Äôs opened goat
* Door C = the remaining one

### Case 1: Car behind Door A (your choice)

Monty opens B (goat).
Switch ‚Üí lose.

### Case 2: Car behind Door B

Monty can‚Äôt open B (it has car). He opens C (goat).
Switch ‚Üí win.

### Case 3: Car behind Door C

Monty opens B (goat).
Switch ‚Üí win.

‚úÖ So switching wins in **2 out of 3** scenarios.

---

## üí° Alternative intuition ‚Äî ‚ÄúExpand the doors‚Äù

If 3 doors confuse you, imagine **100 doors**:

* 1 has a car, 99 have goats.
* You pick one (1% chance of being correct).
* Monty opens 98 goat doors, leaving 1 closed door plus yours.

Would you switch?
Obviously yes ‚Äî your first choice had 1% chance of being right, so the **other door has 99% chance**.

Same logic, just smaller numbers in the 3-door version.

---

## üßÆ Mathematical Verification

Let (A) = event "car behind your chosen door".

[
P(A) = \frac{1}{3}, \quad P(\text{car behind another door}) = \frac{2}{3}.
]

Monty‚Äôs action doesn‚Äôt change the probability of (A).
He only reveals which goat door can be safely ignored.

So when he opens one goat door, the **entire 2/3 probability mass** shifts onto the **remaining unopened door**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation (conceptually)

If you played 3,000 games:

* Staying: you'd win ‚âà 1,000 times.
* Switching: you'd win ‚âà 2,000 times.

---

## üß† Real-world takeaway

The Monty Hall problem shows the power of **conditional probability** ‚Äî
the host‚Äôs knowledge changes the sample space.

This is a direct application of **Bayesian reasoning**:
[
P(\text{Car behind your door} \mid \text{Monty opens a goat}) = 1/3, \
P(\text{Car behind other door} \mid \text{Monty opens a goat}) = 2/3.
]

---

Nice ‚Äî let‚Äôs do the **Monty Hall** problem *explicitly with Bayes‚Äô theorem*. I‚Äôll keep the standard assumptions up front, then show the full Bayes calculation and several variants so you see exactly where the 2/3 comes from.

---

# Assumptions (the usual Monty rules)

1. You pick **Door 1**.
2. There is exactly **one car** and two goats, uniformly placed (prior for each door = 1/3).
3. **Monty knows** where the car is.
4. Monty **always** opens a different door than yours and **always** opens a door with a goat.
5. If Monty has a choice between two goat doors, he chooses **uniformly at random** between them.

We will compute the posterior probabilities using Bayes after Monty opens **Door 3** and shows a goat.

---

# Step 1 ‚Äî Enumerate hypotheses (priors)

Let:

* (H_1): car is behind Door 1 (your original pick). (P(H_1)=1/3).
* (H_2): car is behind Door 2. (P(H_2)=1/3).
* (H_3): car is behind Door 3. (P(H_3)=1/3).

Monty opens Door 3 (call that event (M_3)). We want (P(H_i \mid M_3)) for (i=1,2,3).

---

# Step 2 ‚Äî Likelihoods (P(M_3 \mid H_i)) under our assumptions

* If (H_1) (car is behind Door 1): Monty can open Door 2 *or* Door 3, both goats ‚Äî he chooses uniformly ‚Üí
  [
  P(M_3 \mid H_1) = \tfrac{1}{2}.
  ]
* If (H_2) (car behind Door 2): Monty **cannot** open Door 2 (car) so he must open Door 3 (the only goat available) ‚Üí
  [
  P(M_3 \mid H_2) = 1.
  ]
* If (H_3) (car behind Door 3): Monty will **never** open Door 3 (it has the car) ‚Üí
  [
  P(M_3 \mid H_3) = 0.
  ]

---

# Step 3 ‚Äî Use Bayes‚Äô theorem

Bayes rule:
[
P(H_i \mid M_3) = \frac{P(M_3 \mid H_i),P(H_i)}{P(M_3)},
]
where
[
P(M_3) = \sum_{j=1}^3 P(M_3\mid H_j)P(H_j).
]

Compute (P(M_3)):
[
P(M_3)=\frac{1}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\cdot 1 + \frac{1}{3}\cdot 0
= \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{2}.
]

Now posteriors:

* For (H_1):
  [
  P(H_1\mid M_3) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{3}.
  ]

* For (H_2):
  [
  P(H_2\mid M_3) = \frac{1\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{2}{3}.
  ]

* For (H_3):
  [
  P(H_3\mid M_3) = \frac{0\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 0.
  ]

So after Monty opens Door 3 and shows a goat:

* Probability car is behind **your** door (Door 1) = **1/3**.
* Probability car is behind the **other unopened** door (Door 2) = **2/3**.

Conclusion: **Switching** to Door 2 gives you a 2/3 chance of winning the car.

---

# Intuition from the Bayes steps

* Your initial 2/3 chance of having a goat (i.e., car behind *someone else*) does not disappear when Monty opens a goat door. Monty‚Äôs act of opening a goat **concentrates** that 2/3 probability onto the single remaining unopened door.
* Bayes formalizes that concentration: the likelihoods show that seeing Monty open Door 3 is much more likely when the car was behind Door 2 (probability 1) than when it was behind your door (probability 1/2).

---

# Variant: Monty‚Äôs choice not uniform when he has options

We assumed Monty chooses randomly when he has 2 goat doors. If instead Monty uses a biased rule (e.g., prefers opening Door 2 with probability 0.9 when he has a choice), the likelihoods change and so do posteriors. You must include Monty‚Äôs rule in the model. Bayes always works ‚Äî you just need the right (P(M_3 \mid H_i)).

Example quick formula if bias (q) = prob Monty opens Door 3 when he has a choice:

* (P(M_3|H_1)=q) (instead of 1/2).
* (P(M_3|H_2)=1).
* (P(M_3|H_3)=0).

Then
[
P(H_2|M_3)=\frac{1\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{ \frac{1}{3}q + \frac{1}{3}\cdot 1 } = \frac{1}{q+1}.
]
Plug (q=\tfrac12) ‚Üí (P(H_2|M_3)=\tfrac{2}{3}) as before. If Monty strongly prefers opening Door 3 ((q) near 1), the evidence is less informative and posterior for (H_2) goes toward 1/2. If Monty avoids Door 3 ((q) small), posterior for (H_2) approaches 1 (makes switching even more compelling).

---

# 100-door intuition with Bayes

Same reasoning scales: pick 1 of 100 (prior on your chosen door = 1/100). Monty, knowing where the car is, opens 98 goat doors and leaves 1 other closed door. Under the same assumptions (he never opens the car, and he opens all but one goat), the remaining unopened door collects almost all the prior probability (99/100) ‚Äî Bayes says switch.

---

# Odds form (quick)

Bayes in odds form:
[
\frac{P(H_2\mid M_3)}{P(H_1\mid M_3)}
= \frac{P(M_3\mid H_2)}{P(M_3\mid H_1)}\cdot\frac{P(H_2)}{P(H_1)}.
]
Plug numbers: (\frac{1}{1/2}\cdot\frac{1/3}{1/3}=2). So odds for (H_2) vs (H_1) are 2:1 ‚Üí probabilities 2/3 and 1/3.

---

# Final takeaway

* With the standard Monty rules, **switching is strictly better**: it gives a 2/3 win probability vs 1/3 if you stay.
* Bayes‚Äô theorem just makes this precise: you update the prior (1/3 for each door) with Monty‚Äôs action (likelihoods) to obtain the posterior (1/3 vs 2/3).

---

Perfect üëè ‚Äî let‚Äôs go for the **simplest, clearest explanation** of **Bayes‚Äô Theorem**, with a focus on what **prior**, **likelihood**, and **posterior** really mean.

You‚Äôll get both the *intuition* and a *simple example* that cements it.

---

# üéØ The Big Idea

Bayes‚Äô Theorem helps you **update what you believe (your prior)** when you get **new evidence (data)**.

It‚Äôs just:
[
\text{New belief (posterior)} ;=; \frac{\text{Evidence if true (likelihood)} \times \text{Old belief (prior)}}{\text{Overall evidence (normalizing factor)}}.
]

In symbols:
[
P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H) \cdot P(H)}{P(E)}.

# üé® Example: The Simple Medical Test

Imagine a disease test.

* 1% of people have the disease. ‚Üí ( P(D) = 0.01 ) (**prior**)
* The test is **99% accurate** if you‚Äôre sick. ‚Üí ( P(+|D) = 0.99 )
* The test has **5% false positives** ‚Üí ( P(+|\text{no D}) = 0.05 )

You take the test and it‚Äôs **positive** (+).
We want: ( P(D|+) ) ‚Äî the chance you *actually* have the disease.

---

### Step 1: Write Bayes‚Äô formula

[
P(D|+) = \frac{P(+|D) \cdot P(D)}{P(+)}.
]

We already have everything except (P(+)).

---

### Step 2: Compute total probability of a positive test

[
P(+) = P(+|D)P(D) + P(+|\text{no D})P(\text{no D})
]

[
= (0.99)(0.01) + (0.05)(0.99) = 0.0099 + 0.0495 = 0.0594.
]

---

### Step 3: Compute the posterior

[
P(D|+) = \frac{0.99 \times 0.01}{0.0594} = 0.1667 \approx 17%.
]

---

‚úÖ **Interpretation:**
Even though the test is ‚Äú99% accurate,‚Äù the chance you actually have the disease after testing positive is only **~17%**.

Why? Because the disease is **rare (low prior)** ‚Äî so most positives come from false alarms.

# üß© Putting It All Together

| Term                  | Symbol   | Value  | Meaning                    |                               |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Prior                 | ( P(D) ) | 0.01   | Rare disease (before test) |                               |
| Likelihood            | ( P(+    | D) )   | 0.99                       | Test usually catches it       |

| Posterior             | ( P(D    | +) )   | 0.1667                     | Updated belief after seeing + |

---

# üí° Easy Way to Remember

**Posterior ‚àù Likelihood √ó Prior**

> The posterior is *proportional to* how likely the data would be if the hypothesis were true, weighted by how plausible the hypothesis was before seeing the data.

---

# ü™Ñ Everyday Analogy

Suppose you think it‚Äôs unlikely to rain today (10% chance).
But you see dark clouds forming ‚Äî and dark clouds usually appear on 80% of rainy days but only 20% of dry days.

Then:

* Prior = 10% (rain unlikely)
* Likelihood = 80% (dark clouds given rain)
* Evidence = mix of both cases

Bayes updates your belief:
Now maybe you believe rain is ~30‚Äì40% likely ‚Äî higher than before but still not certain.

That‚Äôs Bayesian thinking!

---
Excellent ‚Äî a **visual explanation** is the best way to *finally make Bayes click*! üß†
Let‚Äôs build it step by step using an **area (frequency)** diagram ‚Äî no heavy math, just intuition.

---

## üéØ Scenario: The Medical Test (again)

* 1% of people have the disease ‚Üí **rare disease**
* Test catches 99% of sick people ‚Üí **very accurate**
* False positives happen 5% of the time ‚Üí **not perfect**

We‚Äôll visualize what happens in a sample of **10,000 people**.

---

## üß© Step 1: Start with the Prior

> ‚ÄúBefore testing, how many people *really* have the disease?‚Äù

| Group        | %   | Count (out of 10,000) |
| ------------ | --- | --------------------- |
| Have disease | 1%  | **100**               |
| No disease   | 99% | **9,900**             |

So our **prior** is:

* (P(D) = 0.01)
* (P(\text{no D}) = 0.99)

---

## üßÆ Step 2: Apply the Test (the Likelihood)

### Among the 100 diseased:

* Test positive (true positive): (99%) ‚Üí **99 people**
* Test negative (false negative): (1%) ‚Üí **1 person**

### Among the 9,900 healthy:

* Test positive (false positive): (5%) ‚Üí **495 people**
* Test negative (true negative): (95%) ‚Üí **9,405 people**

---

## üé® Step 3: Visualize It

Imagine a big box of 10,000 people:

```
+-----------------------------+
|  Positive tests  | Negative |
|------------------|----------|
|  True + : 99     | False - : 1   |  ‚Üê Sick (100 total)
|  False + : 495   | True - : 9405 |  ‚Üê Healthy (9,900 total)
+-----------------------------+
```

---

## üîç Step 4: Count the Positives (the Evidence)

Total positive tests = True Positives + False Positives
‚Üí 99 + 495 = **594 positives**

Now, among those **594 positives**,
how many *actually* have the disease?

[
P(D|+) = \frac{99}{594} \approx 0.1667 = 17%.
]

‚úÖ So even though the test is ‚Äú99% accurate,‚Äù only 17% of positives are truly sick!

---

## üß† Step 5: See How Prior + Likelihood Combine

| Concept        | In Our Example                | Meaning                                  |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Prior**      | 1% (disease rare)             | Start with what‚Äôs likely before evidence |
| **Likelihood** | Test is 99% sensitive         | How well the evidence fits ‚Äúdisease‚Äù     |
| **Evidence**   | 594 positives overall         | Total data you observed                  |
| **Posterior**  | 17% (now believe you‚Äôre sick) | Updated belief after evidence            |

---

## üìä Step 6: Intuition from the Diagram

Think of the **blue square** (below) as everyone who tested positive.

```
Total positives (594)
|-------------------------------|
|  99 True Positives (blue)     |
| 495 False Positives (gray)    |
|-------------------------------|
```

Bayes tells you:

> Posterior probability = Blue / (Blue + Gray)

The blue area comes from the **likelihood √ó prior** (real disease √ó accuracy).
The gray area comes from the **false positive rate √ó how many healthy people there are**.
That‚Äôs why *rare conditions* produce mostly false positives even with good tests.

---

## ü™Ñ Step 7: Simple Takeaway

**Bayes = Filter for Beliefs**

You start with a **belief (prior)**
Then the **data (likelihood)** tells you how plausible that belief is.
Bayes combines them ‚Üí gives you a new **posterior belief**.

[
\text{Posterior} \propto \text{Likelihood} \times \text{Prior}
]

| 1    | Prior      | Before seeing data                        | 1% disease rate   |

# üìò MIT 18.05 Class 3 Notes ‚Äî Conditional Probability, Independence, and Bayes‚Äô Theorem

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Conditional Probability

**Definition**

[
P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)},;P(B)\neq0
]

**Intuition:** restrict attention to the subset (B); measure how much of (B) lies inside (A).

**Example:**
First toss = H in three coin tosses ‚Üí sample space halves ‚Üí (P(3H|1st H)=1/4).

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Multiplication Rule

[
P(A\cap B)=P(A|B),P(B)
]

Useful to build joint probabilities step by step.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Law of Total Probability (LTP)

If (B_1,\ldots,B_n) partition the sample space Œ©,

[
P(A)=\sum_i P(A|B_i),P(B_i)
]

This lets you combine conditional probabilities across cases.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Probability Trees (ASCII)

Trees visualize conditional steps; multiply along branches and sum the relevant paths.

Example ‚Äì Urn problem (5 red, 2 green; color replaced by opposite):

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ R1 (5/7)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ R2 (4/7)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ G2 (3/7)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ G1 (2/7)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ R2 (6/7)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ G2 (1/7)
```

Compute
P(R2) = (5/7)(4/7) + (2/7)(6/7) = 32/49.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Independence

Two events are **independent** if
[
P(A|B)=P(A)\quad\text{or equivalently}\quad P(A\cap B)=P(A)P(B)
]

Example: two coin tosses ‚Üí independent; first = H, total = two H ‚Üí not independent.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Bayes‚Äô Theorem

**Formula**

[
P(H|E)=\frac{P(E|H),P(H)}{P(E)}=\frac{P(E|H),P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H)+P(E|\neg H)P(\neg H)}
]

**Interpretation**

| Term   | Meaning                  |                                |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| (P(H)) | Prior belief             |                                |
| (P(E   | H))                      | Likelihood of evidence under H |
| (P(E)) | Total chance of seeing E |                                |
| (P(H   | E))                      | Posterior (updated belief)     |

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ ASCII Tree for Bayes‚Äô Computation

Generic two-hypothesis situation (like disease test or evil squirrels):

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ H   (P(H))
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E   (P(E|H))
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ¬¨E  (1 - P(E|H))
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ¬¨H  (1 - P(H))
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ E   (P(E|¬¨H))
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ¬¨E  (1 - P(E|¬¨H))
```

To find (P(H|E)):

* Multiply along each branch to get joint probabilities.
* Sum over all E-nodes to get P(E).
* Divide the H‚àßE branch weight by total P(E).

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Example ‚Äì ‚ÄúEvil Squirrels‚Äù

Given:

* (P(Evil)=0.0001)
* (P(Nice)=0.9999)
* (P(Alarm|Evil)=0.99)
* (P(Alarm|Nice)=0.01)

### Bayes

[
P(Evil|Alarm)=\frac{0.99\cdot0.0001}{0.99\cdot0.0001+0.01\cdot0.9999}\approx0.0098
]

‚âà **1% chance** a squirrel is evil given an alarm.

---

### ASCII Tree for Evil Squirrels

```
Root
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Evil (0.0001)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Alarm (0.99)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No Alarm (0.01)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Nice (0.9999)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Alarm (0.01)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ No Alarm (0.99)
```

‚Üí True alarms = 99 (‚âà 1%)
‚Üí False alarms = 9999 (‚âà 99%)

**Conclusion:** System produces 99% false positives ‚Äî not reliable.

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Common Pitfall ‚Äî Base Rate Fallacy

Even with high test accuracy, a low base rate causes most positive signals to be false positives.
Always compare **posterior** (what you want) to **base rate** (prior frequency).

  ]
* Bayes‚Äô formula:
  [
  P(O_1|O_2) = \frac{P(O_2 \cap O_1)}{P(O_2)} = \frac{20/49}{32/49} = \frac{20}{32} = \frac{5}{8}
  ]

---

## **Board Questions**

* 1 car, 2 goats. Contestant chooses a door. Monty opens a goat door. Contestant can switch.

**Question:** Best strategy?

* Options: (a) Switch (b) Don‚Äôt switch (c) It doesn‚Äôt matter
* **Answer:** (a) Switch

**Solution:** Probability tree approach:
[
P_\text{switch}(\text{car}) = P(\text{switch wins}) = 2/3
]

---

### **2. Independence of Dice Events**

* Two dice roll:

  * (A) = first die is 3
  * (B) = sum is 6
  * (C) = sum is 7

**Question:** (A) is independent of?

* Options: (a) B & C (b) B alone (c) C alone (d) Neither
* **Answer:** (c) C alone

**Reason:**
[
P(A) = 1/6, \quad P(A|B) = 1/5 \neq P(A), \quad P(A|C) = 1/6 = P(A)
]

---

### **3. Evil Squirrels (Base Rate Fallacy)**

* MIT campus: 1,000,000 squirrels, 100 evil. Alarm:

  * (P(\text{alarm|evil}) = 0.99)
  * (P(\text{alarm|nice}) = 0.01)

**Questions:**

1. (P(\text{evil | alarm}))
2. Should MIT use the system?

**Solution:**
[
P(\text{evil|alarm}) = \frac{0.99 \cdot 0.0001}{0.99 \cdot 0.0001 + 0.01 \cdot 0.9999} \approx 0.01
]

* **Answer:** No, false positives dominate.

---

### **4. Dice Game**

* One 6-sided, one 8-sided die. Roller picks one die, rolls, reports number.

**Question:** Given the reported number, probability it was the 6-sided die?

**Solution:** Using Bayes‚Äô theorem:
[
P(\text{6-sided | roll 4}) = \frac{P(\text{roll 4 | 6-sided}) P(\text{6-sided})}{P(\text{roll 4})} = \frac{(1/6)(1/2)}{(1/6)(1/2) + (1/8)(1/2)} = \frac{4}{7}
]

* Rolls 7 or 8 ‚Üí (P(\text{6-sided}) = 0)
