# Step 1: Biological motivation → mathematical neuron

### Biological neuron

* Receives **inputs** from other neurons via dendrites.
* Each input is weighted (strength of synapse).
* If total stimulation exceeds threshold, the neuron **fires** (sends spike).

### Abstraction in ANNs

We don’t model spikes. Instead:

$$
z = \sum_i w_i x_i + b
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

* $w_i$: synaptic strength
* $b$: bias term (shifts threshold)
* $\phi(\cdot)$: activation function (e.g. sigmoid, ReLU)

👉 In ANNs, neurons are *differentiable* functions so we can optimize them using calculus.

---

# Step 2: Linear vs nonlinear models

### Purely linear models

Suppose we stack multiple linear transformations:

$$
a = W_2 (W_1 x + b_1) + b_2
$$

This collapses into:

$$
a = W' x + b'
$$

which is **still linear**.
👉 Without **nonlinearity**, depth is useless.

### Why nonlinear?

Nonlinear activations (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.) allow networks to approximate **arbitrary nonlinear mappings**. This is the heart of the **Universal Approximation Theorem** (Hornik, 1989).

---

# Step 3: Single neuron in detail

### Forward pass

For input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$:

$$
z = W x + b \quad (scalar: z = \sum w_i x_i + b)
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

### Choice of activation $\phi$

* **Sigmoid**:
  $\phi(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$
  Range: (0,1). Problem: gradients vanish for large |z|.
* **Tanh**:
  Range: (-1,1). Zero-centered, but still saturates.
* **ReLU**:
  $\phi(z) = \max(0, z)$.
  Pros: fast, non-saturating. Cons: dead neurons possible.
* **Leaky ReLU, ELU, GELU**: designed to avoid dead neurons.

👉 We’ll later compute **derivatives** of each activation for backpropagation.

---

# Step 4: Single-layer network (Perceptron)

A perceptron (1958, Rosenblatt) is just:

$$
\hat{y} = \phi(Wx + b)
$$

with hard threshold $\phi$.
Limitations:

* Can only classify **linearly separable** data.
* XOR problem = unsolvable by perceptron (proved by Minsky & Papert, 1969).

👉 Adding **hidden nonlinear layers** solves this.

---

✅ That’s the **first building block: the single neuron & linear vs nonlinear**.

---
Excellent — let’s pause and **go deep** into these two points before we move forward.

# 1) The **Bias Term** — meaning and use

### Mathematical form

For one neuron:

$$
z = W x + b
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

where $W$ is a weight vector and $b$ is the **bias** (a scalar per neuron).

---

### Intuition: what does $b$ do?

Think of a bias as an **intercept** in linear regression.

* Without bias: the neuron’s output is always forced to pass through the origin (0).
  Example: If inputs are zero, output is forced to be zero.

* With bias: we can **shift the activation function** left or right (for sigmoid/tanh) or **up/down the threshold** (for ReLU).

Graphical example:

* Sigmoid without bias is centered at $z=0$ (threshold at input=0).
* With bias $b$, threshold shifts to input = $-b/w$.

---

### Geometric interpretation

A neuron’s decision boundary is:

$$
Wx + b = 0
$$

This is the equation of a **hyperplane**.

* $W$ defines its orientation (slope, normal vector).
* $b$ shifts it in space (intercept).

👉 **Without bias**, the hyperplane is forced through the origin — very restrictive.
👉 **With bias**, we can represent *any shifted hyperplane*, making the model more expressive.

---

### Practical importance

* Bias enables networks to approximate functions that don’t pass through the origin.
* Imagine modeling $y = x + 1$. Without bias, neuron outputs $y = w x$ can never represent this constant shift.
* In deep nets, biases give neurons the flexibility to activate *even if all inputs are zero*.

👉 **Rule:** Always include biases unless you explicitly know the network should be origin-centered (rare).

---

# 2) The Original Perceptron (Rosenblatt, 1958)

### Perceptron model

Mathematically:

$$
\hat{y} = \phi(Wx + b)
$$

* $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$: input vector.
* $W \in \mathbb{R}^d$: weights.
* $b$: bias.
* $\phi$: **hard threshold function**:

  $$
  \phi(z) = \begin{cases}
  1 & z > 0 \\
  0 & z \le 0
  \end{cases}
  $$

This was an early attempt to mimic biological neurons.

---

### Decision boundary

The perceptron outputs 1 or 0 depending on which side of the hyperplane $Wx + b = 0$ the input lies.
👉 So, it’s a **linear classifier**.

---

### Limitations

* Works only if data is **linearly separable**.
* Cannot solve **XOR** (classic proof).

Why? XOR’s classes can’t be separated with a single straight line. You need at least two lines (i.e., multiple neurons in a hidden layer) to solve it.

This limitation led to the “AI winter” in the 1970s after Minsky & Papert (1969) showed perceptrons were too weak. The breakthrough came in the 1980s with **multi-layer perceptrons + backpropagation**, which solved XOR and much more.

---

✅ So to summarize before we move on:

* **Bias** = allows flexibility by shifting decision boundaries and activations.
* **Perceptron** = a single linear threshold unit, limited to linearly separable problems.
