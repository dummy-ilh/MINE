# Step 1: Biological motivation â†’ mathematical neuron

### Biological neuron

* Receives **inputs** from other neurons via dendrites.
* Each input is weighted (strength of synapse).
* If total stimulation exceeds threshold, the neuron **fires** (sends spike).

### Abstraction in ANNs

We donâ€™t model spikes. Instead:

$$
z = \sum_i w_i x_i + b
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

* $w_i$: synaptic strength
* $b$: bias term (shifts threshold)
* $\phi(\cdot)$: activation function (e.g. sigmoid, ReLU)

ðŸ‘‰ In ANNs, neurons are *differentiable* functions so we can optimize them using calculus.

---

# Step 2: Linear vs nonlinear models

### Purely linear models

Suppose we stack multiple linear transformations:

$$
a = W_2 (W_1 x + b_1) + b_2
$$

This collapses into:

$$
a = W' x + b'
$$

which is **still linear**.
ðŸ‘‰ Without **nonlinearity**, depth is useless.

### Why nonlinear?

Nonlinear activations (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.) allow networks to approximate **arbitrary nonlinear mappings**. This is the heart of the **Universal Approximation Theorem** (Hornik, 1989).

# Step 3: Single neuron in detail

### Forward pass

For input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^d$:

$$
z = W x + b \quad (scalar: z = \sum w_i x_i + b)
$$

$$
a = \phi(z)
$$

### Choice of activation $\phi$

* **Sigmoid**:
  $\phi(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$
  Range: (0,1). Problem: gradients vanish for large |z|.
* **Tanh**:
  Range: (-1,1). Zero-centered, but still saturates.
* **ReLU**:
  $\phi(z) = \max(0, z)$.
  Pros: fast, non-saturating. Cons: dead neurons possible.
* **Leaky ReLU, ELU, GELU**: designed to avoid dead neurons.

ðŸ‘‰ Weâ€™ll later compute **derivatives** of each activation for backpropagation.

---

# Step 4: Single-layer network (Perceptron)

A perceptron (1958, Rosenblatt) is just:

$$
\hat{y} = \phi(Wx + b)
$$

with hard threshold $\phi$.
Limitations:

* Can only classify **linearly separable** data.
* XOR problem = unsolvable by perceptron (proved by Minsky & Papert, 1969).

ðŸ‘‰ Adding **hidden nonlinear layers** solves this.

---

âœ… Thatâ€™s the **first building block: the single neuron & linear vs nonlinear**.

---

ðŸ‘‰ Now, to go deep, I can proceed with a **full lecture on activation functions** next:

* Mathematical definitions
* Derivatives (with explicit formulas)
* Pros/cons in optimization
* When to use which in practice
* Pathologies (saturation, dying neurons) and remedies

Would you like me to **drill into activations next**, or do you prefer we **derive forward-pass equations for an entire MLP first** and then return to activations?
