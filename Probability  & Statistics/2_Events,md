# Events, Discrete Sample Spaces, and Basic Rules of Probability

**18.05 – Class 2**

---

## 1. Event

An **event** is a subset of the sample space.

If:

* Ω = sample space
* ω = outcome

Then an event A is a collection of outcomes:
$[
A \subseteq \Omega
]$

If the actual outcome lies in A, we say the event **occurs**.

Example:
If Ω = {1,2,3,4,5,6},
then A = “even number” = {2,4,6} is an event.

---

## 2. Definition of a Discrete Sample Space

A **discrete sample space** is one in which:

* The outcomes are either finite, or
* Countably infinite (like 0,1,2,3,...)

In a discrete sample space:

* We assign a probability to each individual outcome.
* The total probability must sum to 1.

---

## 3. The Probability Function

A probability function ( P ) assigns a number to each outcome (or event) such that:

### Rule 1 (Nonnegativity)

$[
P(A) \ge 0
]$
for every event A.

### Rule 2 (Total Probability)

$[
P(\Omega) = 1
]$

### Rule 3 (Additivity for Disjoint Events)

If A and B are disjoint (no outcomes in common),
$[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
]$

These three rules define probability in the discrete case.

---

# Some Basic Rules of Probability

From the three axioms above, we can derive important results.

---

## Complement Rule

If ( A^c ) is the complement of A (everything not in A), then:

$[
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
]$

This follows because:

* A and ( A^c ) are disjoint.
* ( A \cup A^c = \Omega )

---

## Example 8

If the probability of an even number is 0.6, what is the probability of an odd number?

### Solution (Informal)

Odd is the complement of even.

$[
P(\text{odd}) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4
]$

---

### More Formal Version

Let:

* ( X ) = the random integer
* ( A ) = event “X is even”
* ( A^c ) = event “X is odd”

We are given:
$[
P(A) = 0.6
]$

Using the complement rule:
$[
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4
]$

---

## Example 9

Let:

* ( A ): “X is a multiple of 2”
* ( B ): “X is odd and less than 10”

Given:
$[
P(A) = 0.6, \quad P(B) = 0.25
]$

### (i) What is ( A \cap B )?

All numbers in A are even.
All numbers in B are odd.

No number can be both even and odd.

Therefore:
$[
A \cap B = \varnothing
]$

The events are **disjoint**.

---

### (ii) What is ( P(A \cup B) )?

Since A and B are disjoint, we use Rule 3:

$[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
]$

$[
= 0.6 + 0.25 = 0.85
]$

---

## Example 10 (Inclusion–Exclusion)

Let:

* ( A ): X is a multiple of 2
* ( B ): X is a multiple of 3
* ( C ): X is a multiple of 6

Given:
$[
P(A) = 0.6
]$
$[
P(B) = 0.3
]$
$[
P(C) = 0.2
]$

We are asked: What is ( P(A \text{ or } B) )?

---

### Step 1: Translate “or”

“Or” means union:

$[
A \text{ or } B = A \cup B
]$

---

### Step 2: Understand the Intersection

An integer is divisible by 6 **if and only if** it is divisible by both 2 and 3.

So:
$[
C = A \cap B
]$

This is key.

---

### Step 3: Use Inclusion–Exclusion

For any two events:

$[
P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
]$

Substitute:

$[
P(A \cup B) = 0.6 + 0.3 - 0.2
]$

$[
= 0.7
]$

# Big Conceptual Takeaways

1. Complement Rule:
   $[
   P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
   ]$

2. Disjoint Events:
   $[
   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)
   ]$

3. Inclusion–Exclusion:
   $[
   P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)
   ]$

4. Words → Symbols:

   * “or” → union ( \cup )
   * “and” → intersection ( \cap )
   * “not” → complement ( ^c )
